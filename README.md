Filament is a real-time physically based rendering engine for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows,
and WebGL. It is designed to be as small as possible and as efficient as possible on Android.

## Download

[Download Filament releases](https://github.com/google/filament/releases) to access stable builds.
Filament release archives contains host-side tools that are required to generate assets.

Make sure you always use tools from the same release as the runtime library. This is particularly
important for `matc` (material compiler).

If you'd rather build Filament yourself, please refer to our [build manual](BUILDING.md).

### Android

Android projects can simply declare Filament libraries as Maven dependencies:

```gradle
repositories {
    // ...
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.android.filament:filament-android:1.27.2'
}
```

Here are all the libraries available in the group `com.google.android.filament`:

## Rendering with Filament

### Native Linux, macOS and Windows

You must create an `Engine`, a `Renderer` and a `SwapChain`. The `SwapChain` is created from a
native window pointer (an `NSView` on macOS or a `HWND` on Windows for instance):

```c++
Engine* engine = Engine::create();
SwapChain* swapChain = engine->createSwapChain(nativeWindow);
Renderer* renderer = engine->createRenderer();
```

To render a frame you must then create a `View`, a `Scene` and a `Camera`:

```c++
Camera* camera = engine->createCamera(EntityManager::get().create());
View* view = engine->createView();
Scene* scene = engine->createScene();

view->setCamera(camera);
view->setScene(scene);
```

Renderables are added to the scene:

```c++
Entity renderable = EntityManager::get().create();
// build a quad
RenderableManager::Builder(1)
        .boundingBox({{ -1, -1, -1 }, { 1, 1, 1 }})
        .material(0, materialInstance)
        .geometry(0, RenderableManager::PrimitiveType::TRIANGLES, vertexBuffer, indexBuffer, 0, 6)
        .culling(false)
        .build(*engine, renderable);
scene->addEntity(renderable);
```

The material instance is obtained from a material, itself loaded from a binary blob generated
by `matc`:

```c++
Material* material = Material::Builder()
        .package((void*) BAKED_MATERIAL_PACKAGE, sizeof(BAKED_MATERIAL_PACKAGE))
        .build(*engine);
MaterialInstance* materialInstance = material->createInstance();
```

To learn more about materials and `matc`, please refer to the
[materials documentation](./docs/Materials.md.html).

To render, simply pass the `View` to the `Renderer`:

```c++
// beginFrame() returns false if we need to skip a frame
if (renderer->beginFrame(swapChain)) {
    // for each View
    renderer->render(view);
    renderer->endFrame();
}
```

For complete examples of Linux, macOS and Windows Filament applications, look at the source files
in the `samples/` directory. These samples are all based on `libs/filamentapp/` which contains the
code that creates a native window with SDL2 and initializes the Filament engine, renderer and views.

For more information on how to prepare environment maps for image-based lighting please refer to
[BUILDING.md](https://github.com/google/filament/blob/main/BUILDING.md#running-the-native-samples).

### Android

See `android/samples` for examples of how to use Filament on Android.

You must always first initialize Filament by calling `Filament.init()`.

Rendering with Filament on Android is similar to rendering from native code (the APIs are largely
the same across languages). You can render into a `Surface` by passing a `Surface` to the
`createSwapChain` method. This allows you to render to a `SurfaceTexture`, a `TextureView` or
a `SurfaceView`. To make things easier we provide an Android specific API called `UiHelper` in the
package `com.google.android.filament.android`. All you need to do is set a render callback on the
helper and attach your `SurfaceView` or `TextureView` to it. You are still responsible for
creating the swap chain in the `onNativeWindowChanged()` callback.

### iOS

Filament is supported on iOS 11.0 and above. See `ios/samples` for examples of using Filament on
iOS.

Filament on iOS is largely the same as native rendering with C++. A `CAEAGLLayer` or `CAMetalLayer`
is passed to the `createSwapChain` method. Filament for iOS supports both Metal (preferred) and
OpenGL ES.

## Assets

To get started you can use the textures and environment maps found respectively in
`third_party/textures` and `third_party/environments`. These assets are under CC0 license. Please
refer to their respective `URL.txt` files to know more about the original authors.

Environments must be pre-processed using
[`cmgen`](https://github.com/google/filament/blob/main/BUILDING.md#running-the-native-samples) or
using the `libiblprefilter` library.
