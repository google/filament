 /*
 * WHY DOES THIS FILE EXIST?
 * -------------------------
 *
 * For each generated wasm file, emscripten generates a corollary JS file that is used to load the
 * wasm and set up its imports / exports. This file is a hand-authored addendum to the JS file that
 * emscripten generates, and we use it to store JavaScript-side utilities such as the asset
 * downloader and BufferDescriptor wrapper.
 *
 * Note that we should avoid certain modern JavaScript features in this file (e.g., for-of loops)
 * because emscripten uses a fairly rusty minifier.
