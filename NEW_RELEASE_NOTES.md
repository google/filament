## Release notes for next branch cut
- engine: fix PCSS soft shadows of point and spot lights using the directional light's bulb radius
- engine: fix a shader program leak when rendering PCSS or VSM shadows with the program cache
  disabled
- vulkan: the backend now keeps its `VkPipelineCache` across runs through `Platform::setBlobFunc`,
  as the GL backend does for program binaries; the blob functions must be set before the `Engine`
  is created
