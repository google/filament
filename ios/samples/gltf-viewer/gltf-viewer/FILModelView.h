/**
 * FILModelView is a UIView that renders glTF models with an orbit controller.
 *
 * FILModelView owns a Filament engine, renderer, swapchain, view, and scene. It allows clients to
 * access these objects via read-only properties. The view can display only one glTF scene at a
 * time, which can be scaled and translated into the viewing frustum by calling transformToUnitCube.
 * All ECS entities can be accessed and modified via the `asset` property.
 *
 * For GLB files, clients can call loadModelGlb and pass in an NSData* with the contents of the GLB
 * file. For glTF files, clients can call loadModelGltf and pass in an NSData* with the JSON
 * contents, as well as a callback for loading external resources.
 *
 * FILModelView reduces much of the boilerplate required for simple Filament applications, but
 * clients still have the responsibility of adding an IndirectLight and Skybox to the scene.
 * Additionally, clients should: call render and animator->applyAnimation from a CADisplayLink frame
 * callback.
 *
 * See ios/samples/gltf-viewer for a usage example.
