/**
 * Annotation used for marking methods and fields that are called by reflection. Useful for keeping
 * components that would otherwise be removed by Proguard. Use the value parameter to mention a file
 * that calls this method.
 *
 * Note that adding this annotation to a method is not enough to guarantee that
 * it is kept - either its class must be referenced elsewhere in the program, or
 * the class must be annotated with this as well.
 *
 * Usage example:<br />
 *  {@code
 *  @UsedByReflection("PeopleListItemView.java")
    public PeopleListItemViewV11(Context context) {
        super(context);
    }
    }
