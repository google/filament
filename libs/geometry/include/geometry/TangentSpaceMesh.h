 * This class builds Filament-style TANGENTS buffers given an input mesh.
 *
 * This class enables the client to chose between several algorithms. The client can retrieve the
 * result through the `get` methods on the class. If the chosen algorithm did not remesh the input,
 * the client is advised to just use the data they provided instead of querying.  For example, if
 * the chosen method is Algorithm::FRISVAD, then the client should not need to call getPositions().
 * We will simply copy from the input `positions` in that case.
 *
 * If the client calls getPositions() and positions were not provided as input, we will throw
 * and exception. Similar behavior will apply to UVs.
 *
 * This class supersedes the implementation in SurfaceOrientation.h
