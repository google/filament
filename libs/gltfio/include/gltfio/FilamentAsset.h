/**
 * \class FilamentAsset FilamentAsset.h gltfio/FilamentAsset.h
 * \brief Owns a bundle of Filament objects that have been created by AssetLoader.
 *
 * For usage instructions, see the documentation for AssetLoader.
 *
 * This class owns a hierarchy of entities that have been loaded from a glTF asset. Every entity has
 * a filament::TransformManager component, and some entities also have \c Name, \c Renderable,
 * \c Light, or \c Camera components.
 *
 * In addition to the aforementioned entities, an asset has strong ownership over a list of
 * filament::VertexBuffer, filament::IndexBuffer, filament::MaterialInstance, filament::Texture,
 * and, optionally, a simple animation engine (gltfio::Animator).
 *
 * Clients must use ResourceLoader to create filament::Texture objects, compute tangent quaternions,
 * and upload data into vertex buffers and index buffers.
 *
 * \todo Only the default glTF scene is loaded, other glTF scenes are ignored.

     * camera's projection.

     * To change the aspect ratio of the glTF camera:
     *
     *     camera->setScaling(double4 {1.0 / newAspectRatio, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0});
