 * AssetPipeline offers access to glTF processing facilities, independent of the Filament renderer.
 *
 * This is the place for things like atlasing, baking, and optimization of glTF scenes.
 *
 * One instance of AssetPipeline is a context object that makes it simple to manage memory for all
 * involved resources. When the pipeline dies, all its associated asset data are freed, and all
 * associated AssetHandle objects become invalid.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * AssetPipeline pipeline;
 * AssetPipeline::AssetHandle asset = pipeline.load("source.gltf");
 * asset = pipeline.flatten(asset);
 * asset = pipeline.parameterize(asset);
 * asset = pipeline.optimize(asset);
 * pipeline.save(asset, "result.gltf", "result.bin");
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
