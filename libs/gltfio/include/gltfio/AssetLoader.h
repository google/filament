/**
 * \class AssetLoader AssetLoader.h gltfio/AssetLoader.h
 * \brief Consumes glTF content and produces FilamentAsset objects.
 *
 * AssetLoader consumes a blob of glTF 2.0 content (either JSON or GLB) and produces a FilamentAsset
 * object, which is a bundle of Filament textures, vertex buffers, index buffers, etc. An asset is
 * composed of 1 or more FilamentInstance objects which contain entities and components.
 *
 * Clients must use AssetLoader to create and destroy FilamentAsset objects. This is similar to
 * how filament::Engine is used to create and destroy core objects like VertexBuffer.
 *
 * AssetLoader does not fetch external buffer data or create textures on its own. Clients can use
 * ResourceLoader for this, which obtains the URI list from the asset. This is demonstrated in the
 * code snippet below.
 *
 * AssetLoader also owns a cache of filament::Material objects that may be re-used across multiple
 * loads.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * auto engine = Engine::create();
 * auto materials = createJitShaderProvider(engine);
 * auto decoder = createStbProvider(engine);
 * auto loader = AssetLoader::create({engine, materials});
 *
 * // Parse the glTF content and create Filament entities.
 * std::vector<uint8_t> content(...);
 * FilamentAsset* asset = loader->createAsset(content.data(), content.size());
 * content.clear();
 *
 * // Load buffers and textures from disk.
 * ResourceLoader resourceLoader({engine, ".", true});
 * resourceLoader.addTextureProvider("image/png", decoder)
 * resourceLoader.addTextureProvider("image/jpeg", decoder)
 * resourceLoader.loadResources(asset);
 *
 * // Free the glTF hierarchy as it is no longer needed.
 * asset->releaseSourceData();
 *
 * // Add renderables to the scene.
 * scene->addEntities(asset->getEntities(), asset->getEntityCount());
 *
 * // Extract the animator interface from the FilamentInstance.
 * auto animator = asset->getInstance()->getAnimator();
 *
 * // Execute the render loop and play the first animation.
 * do {
 *      animator->applyAnimation(0, time);
 *      animator->updateBoneMatrices();
 *      if (renderer->beginFrame(swapChain)) {
 *          renderer->render(view);
 *          renderer->endFrame();
 *      }
 * } while (!quit);
 *
 * scene->removeEntities(asset->getEntities(), asset->getEntityCount());
 * loader->destroyAsset(asset);
 * materials->destroyMaterials();
 * delete materials;
 * delete decoder;
 * AssetLoader::destroy(&loader);
 * Engine::destroy(&engine);
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
