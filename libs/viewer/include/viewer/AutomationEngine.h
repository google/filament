/**
 * Provides a convenient way to iterate through an AutomationSpec while pushing settings to Filament
 * and exporting screenshots.
 *
 * Upon construction, the engine is given an immutable reference to an AutomationSpec. The engine is
 * always in one of two states: running or idle. The running state can be entered either immediately
 * (startRunning) or by requesting batch mode (startBatchMode).
 *
 * Clients must call tick() after each frame is rendered, which gives the engine an opportunity to
 * increment the current test (if enough time has elapsed) and request an asychronous screenshot.
 * The time to sleep between tests is configurable and can be set to zero. The engine also waits a
 * specified minimum number of frames between tests.
 *
 * Batch mode is meant for non-interactive applications. In batch mode, the engine defers applying
 * the first test case until the client unblocks it via signalBatchMode(). This is useful when
 * waiting for a large model file to become fully loaded. Batch mode also offers a query
 * (shouldClose) that is triggered after the last screenshot has been written to disk.
