/** CPP-API: The Importer class forms an C++ interface to the functionality of the
*   Open Asset Import Library.
*
* Create an object of this class and call ReadFile() to import a file.
* If the import succeeds, the function returns a pointer to the imported data.
* The data remains property of the object, it is intended to be accessed
* read-only. The imported data will be destroyed along with the Importer
* object. If the import fails, ReadFile() returns a NULL pointer. In this
* case you can retrieve a human-readable error description be calling
* GetErrorString(). You can call ReadFile() multiple times with a single Importer
* instance. Actually, constructing Importer objects involves quite many
* allocations and may take some time, so it's better to reuse them as often as
* possible.
*
* If you need the Importer to do custom file handling to access the files,
* implement IOSystem and IOStream and supply an instance of your custom
* IOSystem implementation by calling SetIOHandler() before calling ReadFile().
* If you do not assign a custion IO handler, a default handler using the
* standard C++ IO logic will be used.
*
* @note One Importer instance is not thread-safe. If you use multiple
* threads for loading, each thread should maintain its own Importer instance.
