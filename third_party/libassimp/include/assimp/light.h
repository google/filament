 *  the point a spot light is looking at (it can even be animated). Assimp
 *  writes the target point as a subnode of a spotlights's main node,
 *  called "<spotName>.Target". However, this is just additional information
 *  then, the transformation tracks of the main node make the
 *  spot light already point in the right direction.
