 \section intro Introduction

  Welcome to the irrXML API documentation.
  Here you'll find any information you'll need to develop applications with
  irrXML. If you look for a tutorial on how to start, take a look at the \ref irrxmlexample,
  at the homepage of irrXML at <A HREF="http://xml.irrlicht3d.org" >xml.irrlicht3d.org</A> 
  or into the SDK in the directory \example.
 
  irrXML is intended to be a high speed and easy-to-use XML Parser for C++, and
  this documentation is an important part of it. If you have any questions or
  suggestions, just send a email to the author of the engine, Nikolaus Gebhardt
  (niko (at) irrlicht3d.org). For more informations about this parser, see \ref history.

  \section features Features

  irrXML provides forward-only, read-only 
     access to a stream of non validated XML data. It was fully implemented by
	 Nikolaus Gebhardt. Its current features are:

	 - It it fast as lighting and has very low memory usage. It was 
	   developed with the intention of being used in 3D games, as it already has been.
	 - irrXML is very small: It only consists of 60 KB of code and can be added easily
	   to your existing project.
	 - Of course, it is platform independent and works with lots of compilers.
	 - It is able to parse ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 text files, both in 
	   little and big endian format. 
	 - Independent of the input file format, the parser can return all strings in ASCII, UTF-8,
	   UTF-16 and UTF-32 format. 
	 - With its optional file access abstraction it has the advantage that it can read not
	   only from files but from any type of data (memory, network, ...). For example when 
	   used with the Irrlicht Engine, it directly reads from compressed .zip files. 
	 - Just like the Irrlicht Engine for which it was originally created, it is extremely easy 
	   to use.
	 - It has no external dependencies, it does not even need the STL. 

	 Although irrXML has some strenghts, it currently also has the following limitations:

	 - The input xml file is not validated and assumed to be correct. 

    \section irrxmlexample Example

    The following code demonstrates the basic usage of irrXML. A simple xml
	file like this is parsed:
    \code
	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<config>
		<!-- This is a config file for the mesh viewer -->
		<model file="dwarf.dea" />
		<messageText caption="Irrlicht Engine Mesh Viewer">
		Welcome to the Mesh Viewer of the &quot;Irrlicht Engine&quot;.
		</messageText>
	</config>
	\endcode

	The code for parsing this file would look like this:
	\code
	#include <irrXML.h>
	using namespace irr; // irrXML is located in the namespace irr::io
	using namespace io;

	#include <string> // we use STL strings to store data in this example

	void main()
	{
		// create the reader using one of the factory functions

		IrrXMLReader* xml = createIrrXMLReader("config.xml");

		// strings for storing the data we want to get out of the file
		std::string modelFile;
		std::string messageText;
		std::string caption;

		// parse the file until end reached

		while(xml && xml->read())
		{
			switch(xml->getNodeType())
			{
			case EXN_TEXT:
				// in this xml file, the only text which occurs is the messageText
				messageText = xml->getNodeData();
				break;
			case EXN_ELEMENT:
				{
					if (!strcmp("model", xml->getNodeName()))
						modelFile = xml->getAttributeValue("file");
					else
					if (!strcmp("messageText", xml->getNodeName()))
						caption = xml->getAttributeValue("caption");
				}
				break;
			}
		}

		// delete the xml parser after usage
		delete xml;
	}
	\endcode

	\section howto How to use

	Simply add the source files in the /src directory of irrXML to your project. Done.

	\section license License

	The irrXML license is based on the zlib license. Basicly, this means you can do with
	irrXML whatever you want:

	Copyright (C) 2002-2005 Nikolaus Gebhardt

	This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied
	warranty.  In no event will the authors be held liable for any damages
	arising from the use of this software.

	Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
	including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
	freely, subject to the following restrictions:

	1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not
		claim that you wrote the original software. If you use this software
		in a product, an acknowledgment in the product documentation would be
		appreciated but is not required.

	2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
		misrepresented as being the original software.

	3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source distribution.

	\section history History

	As lots of references in this documentation and the source show, this xml 
	parser has originally been a part of the 
	<A HREF="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net" >Irrlicht Engine</A>. But because
	the parser has become very useful with the latest release, people asked for a 
	separate version of it, to be able to use it in non Irrlicht projects. With
	irrXML 1.0, this has now been done.
