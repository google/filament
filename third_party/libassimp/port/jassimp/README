jassimp
-------

Java binding for assimp.

The class model used by jassimp is not a one-to-one mapping of assimps class/
structure model (due to performance considerations). Please read the javadoc
descriptions of AiMesh and AiWrapperProvider.

The jassimp.lwjgl package contains a LWJGL specific wrapper provider and some
application examples using this wrapper



How To Build
------------

 I) native library, for example by issuing this command in jassimp-native/src:

    $ gcc jassimp.cpp -I/usr/lib/jvm/default/include/ \
      -I/usr/lib/jvm/default/include/linux -lassimp -shared -fPIC -o libjassimp.so

    libjassimp.so is required at runtime and must be located in java.library.path.

II) Java binding
    The java library is built using ant. Executing "ant" in the port/jassimp
    directory should be sufficient to build the library including docs. You
    still need to build the native library separately, see above
    
    The java build is configured to create java 1.6 classes



Limitations
-----------

Not all data imports have been tested yet, especially the countless texture
parameters. If you find bugs please report them.

jassimp supports most of assimps features. Current limitations are
* only importing scenes is supported. There are some methods that allow a
  modification of the returned objects, but these should be considered as
  work in progress. Full blown export support is planned for a future release 
* no support for mesh animations
* no support for embedded textures
* no support for importer configurations
* some texture related material properties are not exposed via the API but only 
  accessible by traversing the list of properties. However this limitation is
  also present in the c-API ...
