D bindings for the Assimp library (http://assimp.sf.net).
---

These bindings provide access to Assimp's C API. They were directly created
from the C header files.

You should be able to create sufficient DDoc documentation for the bindings
using your favourite build tool (such as Rebuild). Please refer to the main
(Doxygen-generated) documentation for general topics.

Please note that the bindings have only been tested on 32 bit systems, they have
yet to be adapted for the different size of the integer types in 64 bit builds
of Assimp.
