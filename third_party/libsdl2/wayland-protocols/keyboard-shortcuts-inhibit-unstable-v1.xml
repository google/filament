  <description summary="Protocol for inhibiting the compositor keyboard shortcuts">
    This protocol specifies a way for a client to request the compositor
    to ignore its own keyboard shortcuts for a given seat, so that all
    key events from that seat get forwarded to a surface.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
    backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible
    changes may be added together with the corresponding interface
    version bump.
    Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version
    number in the protocol and interface names and resetting the
    interface version. Once the protocol is to be declared stable,
    the 'z' prefix and the version number in the protocol and
    interface names are removed and the interface version number is
    reset.

    <description summary="context object for keyboard shortcuts inhibitor">
      A keyboard shortcuts inhibitor instructs the compositor to ignore
      its own keyboard shortcuts when the associated surface has keyboard
      focus. As a result, when the surface has keyboard focus on the given
      seat, it will receive all key events originating from the specified
      seat, even those which would normally be caught by the compositor for
      its own shortcuts.

      The Wayland compositor is however under no obligation to disable
      all of its shortcuts, and may keep some special key combo for its own
      use, including but not limited to one allowing the user to forcibly
      restore normal keyboard events routing in the case of an unwilling
      client. The compositor may also use the same key combo to reactivate
      an existing shortcut inhibitor that was previously deactivated on
      user request.

      When the compositor restores its own keyboard shortcuts, an
      "inactive" event is emitted to notify the client that the keyboard
      shortcuts inhibitor is not effectively active for the surface and
      seat any more, and the client should not expect to receive all
      keyboard events.

      When the keyboard shortcuts inhibitor is inactive, the client has
      no way to forcibly reactivate the keyboard shortcuts inhibitor.

      The user can chose to re-enable a previously deactivated keyboard
      shortcuts inhibitor using any mechanism the compositor may offer,
      in which case the compositor will send an "active" event to notify
      the client.

      If the surface is destroyed, unmapped, or loses the seat's keyboard
      focus, the keyboard shortcuts inhibitor becomes irrelevant and the
      compositor will restore its own keyboard shortcuts but no "inactive"
      event is emitted in this case.

    <event name="active">
      <description summary="shortcuts are inhibited">
	This event indicates that the shortcut inhibitor is active.

	The compositor sends this event every time compositor shortcuts
	are inhibited on behalf of the surface. When active, the client
	may receive input events normally reserved by the compositor
	(see zwp_keyboard_shortcuts_inhibitor_v1).

	This occurs typically when the initial request "inhibit_shortcuts"
	first becomes active or when the user instructs the compositor to
	re-enable and existing shortcuts inhibitor using any mechanism
	offered by the compositor.
