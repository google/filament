 * Atomic operations.
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * If you are not an expert in concurrent lockless programming, you should
 * only be using the atomic lock and reference counting functions in this
 * file.  In all other cases you should be protecting your data structures
 * with full mutexes.
 *
 * The list of "safe" functions to use are:
 *  SDL_AtomicLock()
 *  SDL_AtomicUnlock()
 *  SDL_AtomicIncRef()
 *  SDL_AtomicDecRef()
 *
 * Seriously, here be dragons!
 * ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 *
 * You can find out a little more about lockless programming and the
 * subtle issues that can arise here:
 * http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee418650%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
 *
 * There's also lots of good information here:
 * http://www.1024cores.net/home/lock-free-algorithms
 * http://preshing.com/
 *
 * These operations may or may not actually be implemented using
 * processor specific atomic operations. When possible they are
 * implemented as true processor specific atomic operations. When that
 * is not possible the are implemented using locks that *do* use the
 * available atomic operations.
 *
 * All of the atomic operations that modify memory are full memory barriers.

 *
 * The atomic locks are efficient spinlocks using CPU instructions,
 * but are vulnerable to starvation and can spin forever if a thread
 * holding a lock has been terminated.  For this reason you should
 * minimize the code executed inside an atomic lock and never do
 * expensive things like API or system calls while holding them.
 *
 * The atomic locks are not safe to lock recursively.
 *
 * Porting Note:
 * The spin lock functions and type are required and can not be
 * emulated because they are used in the atomic emulation code.

/**
 * Memory barriers are designed to prevent reads and writes from being
 * reordered by the compiler and being seen out of order on multi-core CPUs.
 *
 * A typical pattern would be for thread A to write some data and a flag,
 * and for thread B to read the flag and get the data. In this case you
 * would insert a release barrier between writing the data and the flag,
 * guaranteeing that the data write completes no later than the flag is
 * written, and you would insert an acquire barrier between reading the
 * flag and reading the data, to ensure that all the reads associated
 * with the flag have completed.
 *
 * In this pattern you should always see a release barrier paired with
 * an acquire barrier and you should gate the data reads/writes with a
 * single flag variable.
 *
 * For more information on these semantics, take a look at the blog post:
 * http://preshing.com/20120913/acquire-and-release-semantics
