 *
 *  The convention for naming hints is SDL_HINT_X, where "SDL_X" is
 *  the environment variable that can be used to override the default.
 *
 *  In general these hints are just that - they may or may not be
 *  supported or applicable on any given platform, but they provide
 *  a way for an application or user to give the library a hint as
 *  to how they would like the library to work.

/** \brief Allows back-button-press events on Windows Phone to be marked as handled
 *
 *  Windows Phone devices typically feature a Back button.  When pressed,
 *  the OS will emit back-button-press events, which apps are expected to
 *  handle in an appropriate manner.  If apps do not explicitly mark these
 *  events as 'Handled', then the OS will invoke its default behavior for
 *  unhandled back-button-press events, which on Windows Phone 8 and 8.1 is to
 *  terminate the app (and attempt to switch to the previous app, or to the
 *  device's home screen).
 *
 *  Setting the SDL_HINT_WINRT_HANDLE_BACK_BUTTON hint to "1" will cause SDL
 *  to mark back-button-press events as Handled, if and when one is sent to
 *  the app.
 *
 *  Internally, Windows Phone sends back button events as parameters to
 *  special back-button-press callback functions.  Apps that need to respond
 *  to back-button-press events are expected to register one or more
 *  callback functions for such, shortly after being launched (during the
 *  app's initialization phase).  After the back button is pressed, the OS
 *  will invoke these callbacks.  If the app's callback(s) do not explicitly
 *  mark the event as handled by the time they return, or if the app never
 *  registers one of these callback, the OS will consider the event
 *  un-handled, and it will apply its default back button behavior (terminate
 *  the app).
 *
 *  SDL registers its own back-button-press callback with the Windows Phone
 *  OS.  This callback will emit a pair of SDL key-press events (SDL_KEYDOWN
 *  and SDL_KEYUP), each with a scancode of SDL_SCANCODE_AC_BACK, after which
 *  it will check the contents of the hint, SDL_HINT_WINRT_HANDLE_BACK_BUTTON.
 *  If the hint's value is set to "1", the back button event's Handled
 *  property will get set to 'true'.  If the hint's value is set to something
 *  else, or if it is unset, SDL will leave the event's Handled property
 *  alone.  (By default, the OS sets this property to 'false', to note.)
 *
 *  SDL apps can either set SDL_HINT_WINRT_HANDLE_BACK_BUTTON well before a
 *  back button is pressed, or can set it in direct-response to a back button
 *  being pressed.
 *
 *  In order to get notified when a back button is pressed, SDL apps should
 *  register a callback function with SDL_AddEventWatch(), and have it listen
 *  for SDL_KEYDOWN events that have a scancode of SDL_SCANCODE_AC_BACK.
 *  (Alternatively, SDL_KEYUP events can be listened-for.  Listening for
 *  either event type is suitable.)  Any value of SDL_HINT_WINRT_HANDLE_BACK_BUTTON
 *  set by such a callback, will be applied to the OS' current
 *  back-button-press event.
 *
 *  More details on back button behavior in Windows Phone apps can be found
 *  at the following page, on Microsoft's developer site:
 *  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj247550(v=vs.105).aspx
