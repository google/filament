 * You should never take a battery status as absolute truth. Batteries
 * (especially failing batteries) are delicate hardware, and the values
 * reported here are best estimates based on what that hardware reports. It's
 * not uncommon for older batteries to lose stored power much faster than it
 * reports, or completely drain when reporting it has 20 percent left, etc.
 *
 * Battery status can change at any time; if you are concerned with power
 * state, you should call this function frequently, and perhaps ignore changes
 * until they seem to be stable for a few seconds.
 *
 * It's possible a platform can only report battery percentage or time left
 * but not both.
 *
 * \param secs seconds of battery life left, you can pass a NULL here if you
 *             don't care, will return -1 if we can't determine a value, or
 *             we're not running on a battery
 * \param pct percentage of battery life left, between 0 and 100, you can pass
 *            a NULL here if you don't care, will return -1 if we can't
 *            determine a value, or we're not running on a battery
 * \returns an SDL_PowerState enum representing the current battery state.
