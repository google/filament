/**
 * Report the user's preferred locale.
 *
 * This returns an array of SDL_Locale structs, the final item zeroed out.
 * When the caller is done with this array, it should call SDL_free() on the
 * returned value; all the memory involved is allocated in a single block, so
 * a single SDL_free() will suffice.
 *
 * Returned language strings are in the format xx, where 'xx' is an ISO-639
 * language specifier (such as "en" for English, "de" for German, etc).
 * Country strings are in the format YY, where "YY" is an ISO-3166 country
 * code (such as "US" for the United States, "CA" for Canada, etc). Country
 * might be NULL if there's no specific guidance on them (so you might get {
 * "en", "US" } for American English, but { "en", NULL } means "English
 * language, generically"). Language strings are never NULL, except to
 * terminate the array.
 *
 * Please note that not all of these strings are 2 characters; some are three
 * or more.
 *
 * The returned list of locales are in the order of the user's preference. For
 * example, a German citizen that is fluent in US English and knows enough
 * Japanese to navigate around Tokyo might have a list like: { "de", "en_US",
 * "jp", NULL }. Someone from England might prefer British English (where
 * "color" is spelled "colour", etc), but will settle for anything like it: {
 * "en_GB", "en", NULL }.
 *
 * This function returns NULL on error, including when the platform does not
 * supply this information at all.
 *
 * This might be a "slow" call that has to query the operating system. It's
 * best to ask for this once and save the results. However, this list can
 * change, usually because the user has changed a system preference outside of
 * your program; SDL will send an SDL_LOCALECHANGED event in this case, if
 * possible, and you can call this function again to get an updated copy of
 * preferred locales.
 *
 * \return array of locales, terminated with a locale with a NULL language
 *         field. Will return NULL on error.
