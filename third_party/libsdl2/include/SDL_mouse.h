 * button. It is not recommended that you capture the mouse for long periods
 * of time, such as the entire time your app is running. For that, you should
 * probably use SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode() or SDL_SetWindowGrab(), depending
 * on your goals.
 *
 * While captured, mouse events still report coordinates relative to the
