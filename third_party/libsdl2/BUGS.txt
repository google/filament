
Bugs are now managed in the SDL issue tracker, here:

    https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues

You may report bugs there, and search to see if a given issue has already
 been reported, discussed, and maybe even fixed.


You may also find help at the SDL forums/mailing list:

    https://discourse.libsdl.org/

Bug reports are welcome here, but we really appreciate if you use the issue
 tracker, as bugs discussed on the mailing list may be forgotten or missed.
