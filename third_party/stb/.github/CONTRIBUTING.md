Pull Requests and Issues are both welcome.

# Responsiveness

General priority order is:

* Crashes
* Bugs
* Warnings
* Enhancements (new features, performance improvement, etc)

Pull requests get priority over Issues. Some pull requests I take
as written; some I modify myself; some I will request changes before
accepting them. Because I've ended up supporting a lot of libraries
(20 as I write this, with more on the way), I am somewhat slow to
address things. Many issues have been around for a long time.

# Pull requests

* Do NOT update the version number in the file. (This just causes conflicts.)
* Do add your name to the list of contributors. (Don't worry about the formatting.) I'll try to remember to add it if you don't, but I sometimes forget as it's an extra step.

# Specific libraries

I generally do not want new file formats for stb_image because
we are trying to improve its security, so increasing its attack
surface is counter-productive.
