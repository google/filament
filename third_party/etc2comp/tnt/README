This folder was created as follows:

    curl -L -O https://github.com/google/etc2comp/archive/9cd0f9c.zip
    unzip 9cd0f9c.zip
    mv etc2comp-* etc2comp

Then, add this line to EtcLib/CMakeLists.txt:

    target_include_directories(EtcLib PUBLIC Etc EtcCodec)

The above line exposes the public header to downstream projects; it's the "Modern CMake"
alternative to the existing lines:

    include_directories(./Etc)
    include_directories(./EtcCodec)
