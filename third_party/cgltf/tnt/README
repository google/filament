This folder was created as follows:

    cd third_party
    curl -L -O https://github.com/jkuhlmann/cgltf/archive/55b161e.zip
    unzip 55b161e.zip
    mv cgltf-* cgltf_new
    rsync -r cgltf_new/ cgltf/ --delete --exclude tnt
    rm -rf 55b161e.zip cgltf_new
    git add cgltf ; git status

We also exposed "cgltf_load_buffer_base64" to the public to enable its use with emscripten
(or any other non-filesystem platform), which we will attempt to fold back into the upstream repo.
