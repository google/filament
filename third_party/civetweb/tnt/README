This is how third_party/civetweb was created:

1. Downloaded from https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/tree/3fadd57
2. `rm -rf Qt VisualStudio ci conan zephyr ci distribution contrib test .git src/third_party`
3. Removed "throw" statements from CivetServer::CivetServer.
4. Replaced all other "throw" statements with abort().
