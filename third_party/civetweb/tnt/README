This is how third_party/civetweb was created:

1. Downloaded from https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/tree/3fadd57
2. `rm -rf Qt VisualStudio ci conan zephyr ci distribution contrib test .git src/third_party`
3. In the cpp file, removed "throw" statements from CivetServer::CivetServer.
4. In the cpp file, replaced all other "throw" statements with abort().
5. In the C file, replaced fseeko with fseek.
6. In the C file, added a call to __android_log_vprint.
