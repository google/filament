* Determine that normative RFC 2119 terms (MUST, SHOULD, MAY, etc.) are
  truly intended in all cases where capitalized.

* Several passages could be made clearer.

  * Overall edit for scope.  Portions are phrased as an introduction to
    the 0.1.3 RIFF container additions, rather than a holistic guide to
    WebP.

  * To wit, suggest s/[spec|specification]/guide/g .  "Spec" can imply a
    standards track; in any case it's too formal for a work in progress.
