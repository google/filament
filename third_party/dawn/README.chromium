Description:
Dawn is an implementation of the WebGPU standard exposed through a C/C++
interface. It provides implementations on top of native graphics APIs like
D3D12, Metal and Vulkan, as well as a client-server implementation to remote
WebGPU outside sandboxed context like Chromium's render processes.
