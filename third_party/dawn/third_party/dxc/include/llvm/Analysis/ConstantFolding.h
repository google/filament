// This file declares routines for folding instructions into constants when all
// operands are constants, for example "sub i32 1, 0" -> "1".
//
// Also, to supplement the basic VMCore ConstantExpr simplifications,
// this file declares some additional folding routines that can make use of
// DataLayout information. These functions cannot go in VMCore due to library
// dependency issues.
