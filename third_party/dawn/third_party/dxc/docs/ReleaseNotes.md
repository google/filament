## Changelog

### Upcoming Release

- Fix regression: [#7510](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues/7510) crash when calling `sizeof` on templated type.
- Fix regression: [#7508](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues/7508) crash when calling `Load` with `status`.
- Header file `dxcpix.h` was added to the release package.

### Version 1.8.2505

#### Potentially breaking changes

- Typed buffers (including ROV buffers) no longer accept types other than vectors and scalars. Any other types will produce descriptive errors. This removes support for appropriately sized matrices and structs. Though it worked in some contexts, code generated from such types was unreliable.
  - Load and Store operations have been refactored as a consequence. Behavior should be identical, please file issues if discrepancies are observed.
- The compiler will now always use the internal validator instead of searching for an external DXIL.dll.  The (hidden) `-select-validator` option has been removed.

#### Notable SPIR-V updates

- Fix unnecessary Int64 requirement when loading Float64
- Added vk::BufferPointer, see [proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/blob/main/proposals/0010-vk-buffer-ref.md) for more details.
- Implement QuadAny and QuadAll (#7266)
- Fix -fvk-invert-y (#7447)

#### Shader Model 6.9 Preview

You can now compile shaders to SM 6.9, but this is a preview, so shader hashes will be set to the PREVIEW_BYPASS pattern.
SM 6.9 shaders will only work with AgilitySDK 1.717.0-preview, a supported preview driver, and use of experimental shader models in developer mode.
Preview shaders will not be compatible with the SM 6.9 release, or likely even later versions of the SM 6.9 preview.

SM 6.9 Preview Additions:

- Long vectors are allowed in HLSL when targeting shader model 6.9. Vectors up to 1024 elements in length can be loaded from/stored to raw buffers and used in elementwise operations. See the [long vector proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/blob/main/proposals/0026-hlsl-long-vector-type.md) for more details.
- HLSL Vectors are still limited to a maximum of 4 elements when used in certain contexts:
  - entry function inputs/outputs
  - parameter, payload, attribute, and node record types for mesh, raytracing, and node shaders
  - constant buffers (cbuffer), texture buffers (tbuffer), textures and typed buffers
  - Note: some HLSL elementwise intrinsics do not yet support long vectors in this preview
- Native vectors of up to 1024 elements are now present in DXIL. This includes vector llvm instructions, load/store, and various elementwise DXIL operations. This may result in smaller DXIL and potentially other performance improvements. See the [dxil vectors proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/blob/main/proposals/0030-dxil-vectors.md) for more details.
- Cooperative Vector operations, a subset of Linear Algebra (LinAlg). See the [cooperative vectors proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/blob/main/proposals/0029-cooperative-vector.md) and the [HLSL header based API proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/blob/main/proposals/0031-hlsl-vector-matrix-operations.md) for more details.
  - New built-in operations are added for multiplying long vectors with a matrix in a ByteAddressBuffer, optionally with accumulation and bias data, as well as outer product and vector accumulate operations.
  - An HLSL header shipped with this release provides a more convenient API for using these built-in operations.
- Support for [Opacity Micromaps](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/blob/main/proposals/0024-opacity-micromaps.md) in DXR shaders as well as for RayQuery.
  - Unlocks DXR performance improvements using triangle sub-divisions for fast hit/miss detection to reduce the need for anyhit invocations.
- Support for [Shader Execution Reordering](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/blob/main/proposals/0027-shader-execution-reordering.md) in DXR.
  - Introduces `MaybeReorderThread()` to explicitly specify where and how shader execution coherence can be improved. `MaybeReorderThread()` can be used in raygeneration shaders.
  - `HitObject` decouples traversal, intersection testing and anyhit shading from closesthit and miss shading for more control and better reordering opportunities. `HitObject` can be used in raygeneration, closesthit and miss shaders.

### Version 1.8.2502

This cumulative release contains numerous bug fixes and stability improvements.

Here are some highlights:

- The incomplete WaveMatrix implementation has been removed. [#6807](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/pull/6807)
- DXIL Validator Hash is open sourced. [#6846](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/pull/6846)
- DXIL container validation for PSV0 part allows any content ordering inside string and semantic index tables. [#6859](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/pull/6859)
- The and() and or() intrinsics will now accept non-integer parameters by casting them to bools. [#7060](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/pull/7060)
- Released executables will now expect the filenames associated with the released pdbs. Instead of expecting `dxc_full.pdb`, `dxc.exe` will now expect `dxc.pdb`.

### Version 1.8.2407

This cumulative release contains numerous bug fixes and stability improvments.

Here are some highlights:

- dxc generates invalid alignment on groupshared matrix load/store instructions in [#6416](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues/6416)
- [Optimization] DXC is missing common factor optimization in some cases in [#6593](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues/6593)
- [SPIR-V] Implement WaveMutliPrefix* in [#6600](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues/6600)
- [SPIR-V] Implement SampleCmpLevel for SM6.7 in [#6613](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues/6613)
- Avoid adding types to default namespace in [#6646](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues/6646)
- Release notes once found in `README.md` can now be found in `ReleaseNotes.md`
- Fixed several bugs in the loop restructurizer. Shader developers who are using -opt-disable structurize-loop-exits-for-unroll to disable the loop restructurizer should consider removing that workaround.

### Version 1.8.2405

DX Compiler Release for May 2024

This release includes two major new elements:

- The introduction of the first component of HLSL 202x
- The inclusion of clang-built Windows binaries

See [the official blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/dxc-1-8-2405-available) for a more detailed description of this release.

HLSL 202x is a placeholder designation for what will ultimately be a new language version that further aligns HLSL with modern language features. It is intended to serve as a bridge to help transition to the expected behavior of the modernized compiler.

To experiment with 202x, use the `-HV 202x` flag. We recommend enabling these warnings as well to catch potential changes in behavior: `-Wconversion -Wdouble-promotion -Whlsl-legacy-literal`.

The first feature available in 202x updates HLSL's treatment of literals to better conform with C/C++. In previous versions, un-suffixed literal types targeted the highest possible precision. This feature revises that to mostly conform with C/C++ behavior. See the above blog post for details.

Clang-built Windows binaries are included in addition to the MSVC-built binaries that have always been shipped before. The clang-built compiler is expected to improve HLSL compile times in many cases. We are eager for feedback about this build positive or negative, related to compile times or correctness.

### Version 1.7.2212

DX Compiler release for December 2022.

- Includes full support of HLSL 2021 for SPIRV generation as well as many HLSL 2021 fixes and enhancements:
  - HLSL 2021's `and`, `or` and `select` intrinsics are now exposed in all language modes. This was done to ease porting code bases to HLSL2021, but may cause name conflicts in existing code.
  - Improved template utility with user-defined types
  - Many additional bug fixes
- Linux binaries are now included.
 This includes the compiler executable, the dynamic library, and the dxil signing library.
- New flags for inspecting compile times:
  - `-ftime-report` flag prints a high level summary of compile time broken down by major phase or pass in the compiler. The DXC
command line will print the output to stdout.
  - `-ftime-trace` flag prints a Chrome trace json file. The output can be routed to a specific file by providing a filename to
the argument using the format `-ftime-trace=<filename>`. Chrome trace files can be opened in Chrome by loading the built-in tracing tool
at chrome://tracing. The trace file captures hierarchial timing data with additional context enabling a much more in-depth profiling
experience.
  - Both new options are supported via the DXC API using the `DXC_OUT_TIME_REPORT` and `DXC_OUT_TIME_TRACE` output kinds respectively.
- IDxcPdbUtils2 enables reading new PDB container part
- `-P` flag will now behave as it does with cl using the file specified by `-Fi` or a default
- Unbound multidimensional resource arrays are allowed
- Diagnostic improvements
- Reflection support on non-Windows platforms; minor updates adding RequiredFeatureFlags to library function reflection and thread group size for AS and MS.

The package includes dxc.exe, dxcompiler.dll, corresponding lib and headers, and dxil.dll for x64 and arm64 platforms on Windows.
