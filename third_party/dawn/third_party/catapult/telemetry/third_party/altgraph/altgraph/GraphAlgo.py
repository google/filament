    Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths

    `Python Cookbook Recipe <http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/119466>`_

    Find shortest paths from the  start node to all nodes nearer than or equal to the end node.

    Dijkstra's algorithm is only guaranteed to work correctly when all edge lengths are positive.
    This code does not verify this property for all edges (only the edges examined until the end
    vertex is reached), but will correctly compute shortest paths even for some graphs with negative
    edges, and will raise an exception if it discovers that a negative edge has caused it to make a mistake.

    Priority dictionary using binary heaps (internal use only)

    David Eppstein, UC Irvine, 8 Mar 2002

    Implements a data structure that acts almost like a dictionary, with two modifications:
        1. D.smallest() returns the value x minimizing D[x].  For this to work correctly,
            all values D[x] stored in the dictionary must be comparable.
        2. iterating "for x in D" finds and removes the items from D in sorted order.
            Each item is not removed until the next item is requested, so D[x] will still
            return a useful value until the next iteration of the for-loop.
            Each operation takes logarithmic amortized time.
