altgraph - a python graph library
=================================

altgraph is a fork of `graphlib <http://pygraphlib.sourceforge.net>`_ tailored
to use newer Python 2.3+ features, including additional support used by the
py2app suite (modulegraph and macholib, specifically).

altgraph is a python based graph (network) representation and manipulation package.
It has started out as an extension to the `graph_lib module <http://www.ece.arizona.edu/~denny/python_nest/graph_lib_1.0.1.html>`_
written by Nathan Denny it has been significantly optimized and expanded.

The :class:`altgraph.Graph.Graph` class is loosely modeled after the `LEDA <http://www.algorithmic-solutions.com/enleda.htm>`_
(Library of Efficient Datatypes)  representation. The library
includes methods for constructing graphs, BFS and DFS traversals,
topological sort, finding connected components, shortest paths as well as a number
graph statistics functions. The library can also visualize graphs
via `graphviz <http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/>`_.

The package contains the following modules:

    -  the :py:mod:`altgraph.Graph` module contains the :class:`~altgraph.Graph.Graph` class that stores the graph data

    -  the :py:mod:`altgraph.GraphAlgo` module implements graph algorithms operating on graphs (:py:class:`~altgraph.Graph.Graph`} instances)

    -  the :py:mod:`altgraph.GraphStat` module contains functions for computing statistical measures on graphs

    -  the :py:mod:`altgraph.GraphUtil` module contains functions for generating, reading and saving graphs

    -  the :py:mod:`altgraph.Dot` module  contains functions for displaying graphs via `graphviz <http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/>`_

    -  the :py:mod:`altgraph.ObjectGraph` module implements a graph of objects with a unique identifier

Installation
------------

Download and unpack the archive then type::

    python setup.py install

This will install the library in the default location. For instructions on
how to customize the install procedure read the output of::

    python setup.py --help install

To verify that the code works run the test suite::

    python setup.py test

Example usage
-------------

Lets assume that we want to analyze the graph below (links to the full picture) GRAPH_IMG.
Our script then might look the following way::

    from altgraph import Graph, GraphAlgo, Dot

    # these are the edges
    edges = [ (1,2), (2,4), (1,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,5), (6,5),
        (6,14), (14,15), (6, 15),  (5,7), (7, 8), (7,13), (12,8),
        (8,13), (11,12), (11,9), (13,11), (9,13), (13,10) ]

    # creates the graph
    graph = Graph.Graph()
    for head, tail in edges:
        graph.add_edge(head, tail)

    # do a forward bfs from 1 at most to 20
    print(graph.forw_bfs(1))

This will print the nodes in some breadth first order::

    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 11, 10, 12, 9]

If we wanted to get the hop-distance from node 1 to node 8
we coud write::

    print(graph.get_hops(1, 8))

This will print the following::

    [(1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 3), (7, 4), (8, 5)]

Node 1 is at 0 hops since it is the starting node, nodes 2,3 are 1 hop away ...
node 8 is 5 hops away. To find the shortest distance between two nodes you
can use::

    print(GraphAlgo.shortest_path(graph, 1, 12))

It will print the nodes on one (if there are more) the shortest paths::

    [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 13, 11, 12]

To display the graph we can use the GraphViz backend::

    dot = Dot.Dot(graph)

    # display the graph on the monitor
    dot.display()

    # save it in an image file
    dot.save_img(file_name='graph', file_type='gif')
