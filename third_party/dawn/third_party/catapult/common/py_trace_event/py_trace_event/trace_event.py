r"""Instrumentation-based profiling for Python.

trace_event allows you to hand-instrument your code with areas of interest.
When enabled, trace_event logs the start and stop times of these events to a
logfile. These resulting logfiles can be viewed with either Chrome's
about:tracing UI or with the standalone trace_event_viewer available at
  http://www.github.com/natduca/trace_event_viewer/

To use trace event, call trace_event_enable and start instrumenting your code:
   from trace_event import *

   if "--trace" in sys.argv:
     trace_enable("myfile.trace")

   @traced
   def foo():
     ...

   class MyFoo(object):
     @traced
     def bar(self):
       ...

trace_event records trace events to an in-memory buffer. If your application is
long running and you want to see the results of a trace before it exits, you can
call trace_flush to write any in-memory events to disk.

To help intregrating trace_event into existing codebases that dont want to add
trace_event as a dependancy, trace_event is split into an import shim
(trace_event.py) and an implementaiton (trace_event_impl/*). You can copy the
shim, trace_event.py, directly into your including codebase. If the
trace_event_impl is not found, the shim will simply noop.

trace_event is safe with regard to Python threads. Simply trace as you normally
would and each thread's timing will show up in the trace file.

Multiple processes can safely output into a single trace_event logfile. If you
fork after enabling tracing, the child process will continue outputting to the
logfile. Use of the multiprocessing module will work as well. In both cases,
however, note that disabling tracing in the parent process will not stop tracing
in the child processes.

  Once enabled, the enabled bit propagates to forked processes and
  multiprocessing subprocesses. Regular child processes, e.g. those created via
  os.system/popen, or subprocess.Popen instances, will not get traced. You can,
  however, enable tracing on those subprocess manually.

  Trace files are multiprocess safe, so you can have multiple processes
  outputting to the same tracelog at once.

  log_file can be one of three things:

    None: a logfile is opened based on sys[argv], namely
          "./" + sys.argv[0] + ".json"

    string: a logfile of the given name is opened.

    file-like object: the fileno() is is used. The underlying file descriptor

  trace_set_clock_snapshot was called before trace start. The synchronization
