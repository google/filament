# Rust upb bindings

This directory contains Rust bindings for upb, attempting to be the a direct
mapping to expose upb to Rust. This should not be used directly by application
code, instead is an implementation detail for Rust Protobuf, which is still
under development but can be found here:
[here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/main/rust).
