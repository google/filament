require 'forwardable'

#
# This class makes RepeatedField act (almost-) like a Ruby Array.
# It has convenience methods that extend the core C or Java based
# methods.
#
# This is a best-effort to mirror Array behavior.  Two comments:
#  1) patches always welcome :)
#  2) if performance is an issue, feel free to rewrite the method
#     in jruby and C.  The source code has plenty of examples
#
# KNOWN ISSUES
#   - #[]= doesn't allow less used approaches such as `arr[1, 2] = 'fizz'`
#   - #concat should return the orig array
#   - #push should accept multiple arguments and push them all at the same time
#
