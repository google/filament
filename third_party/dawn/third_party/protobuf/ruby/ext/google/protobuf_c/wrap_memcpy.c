// On x86-64 Linux with glibc, we link against the 2.2.5 version of memcpy so
// that we avoid depending on the 2.14 version of the symbol. This way,
// distributions that are using pre-2.14 versions of glibc can successfully use
// the gem we distribute
// (https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/2783).
//
// This wrapper is enabled by passing the linker flags -Wl,-wrap,memcpy in
// extconf.rb.
