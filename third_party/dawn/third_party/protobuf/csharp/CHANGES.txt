Welcome to the C# port of Google Protocol Buffers, written by Jon Skeet
(skeet@pobox.com) based on the work of many talented people.

===============================================================================
RELEASE NOTES - Code imported into Google's main protobuf repository
===============================================================================

Everything below note this represents history of protobuf-csharp-port project
before the code was merged into csharp/ subtree of GitHub google/protobuf
repository.
Frozen legacy version of the original project is available in
https://github.com/jskeet/protobuf-csharp-port.

===============================================================================
RELEASE NOTES - Version 2.4.1.555
===============================================================================

Changes:
- Upgrade solution format to Visual Studio 2012.

- Optimized enum parsing.

Fixes:
- Fix for bug in limited input stream's Position, Introduced Position on
  output stream
- Fix for writing a character to a JSON output overflows allocated buffer
- Optimize FromBase64String to return Empty when presented with empty string.

===============================================================================

Changes:
- Add generated_code_attributes option, defaulted to false
- Added support for Portable library

===============================================================================
RELEASE NOTES - Version 2.4.1.473
===============================================================================

Features:
- Added option service_generator_type to control service generation with
  NONE, GENERIC, INTERFACE, or IRPCDISPATCH
- Added interfaces IRpcDispatch and IRpcServerStub to provide for blocking
  services and implementations.
- Added ProtoGen.exe command-line argument "--protoc_dir=" to specify the
  location of protoc.exe.
- Extracted interfaces for ICodedInputStream and ICodedOutputStream to allow
  custom implementation of writers with both speed and size optimizations.
- Addition of the "Google.ProtoBuffers.Serialization" assembly to support
  reading and writing messages to/from XML, JSON, IDictionary<,> and others.
- Several performance related fixes and tweeks
- Issue 3:	Add option to mark generated code with attribute
- Issue 20:	Support for decorating classes [Serializable]
- Issue 21:	Decorate fields with [deprecated=true] as [System.Obsolete]
- Issue 22:	Reusable Builder classes
- Issue 24:	Support for using Json/Xml formats with ICodedInputStream
- Issue 25: Added support for NuGet packages
- Issue 31: Upgraded protoc.exe and descriptor to 2.4.1

Fixes:
- Issue 13:	Message with Field same name as message causes uncompilable .cs

- Big-endian support for float, and double on Silverlight
- Packed and Unpacked parsing allow for all repeated, as per version 2.3
- Fix for leaving Builder a public ctor on internal classes for use with
  generic "where T: new()" constraints.

Other:
- Changed the code signing key to a privately held key
- Reformatted all code and line-endings to C# defaults
- Reworking of performance benchmarks to produce reliable results, option /v2
- Issue 34: Silverlight assemblies are now unit tested

===============================================================================
RELEASE NOTES - Version 2.3.0.277
===============================================================================

Features:
- Added cls_compliance option to generate attributes indicating
  non-CLS-compliance.
- Added file_extension option to control the generated output file's extension.
- Added umbrella_namespace option to place the umbrella class into a nested
  namespace to address issues with proto files having the same name as a
  message it contains.
- Added output_directory option to set the output path for the source file(s).
- Added ignore_google_protobuf option to avoid generating code for includes
  from the google.protobuf package.
- Added the LITE framework (Google.ProtoBuffersLite.dll) and the ability to
  generate code with "option optimize_for = LITE_RUNTIME;".
- Added ability to invoke protoc.exe from within ProtoGen.exe.
