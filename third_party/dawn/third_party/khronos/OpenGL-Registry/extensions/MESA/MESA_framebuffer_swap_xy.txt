    OpenGL ES Extension 328

Dependencies

    Requires OpenGL ES 3.1 or OpenGL 4.3 for FramebufferParameteri.

Overview

    This extension defines a new framebuffer parameter,
    GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SWAP_XY_MESA, that changes the behavior of the reads and
    writes to the framebuffer attachment points. When
    GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SWAP_XY_MESA is GL_TRUE, render commands and pixel transfer
    operations access the backing store of each attachment point with an
    xy-swapped coordinate system. This xy-inversion is relative to the
    coordinate system set when GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SWAP_XY_MESA is GL_FALSE.

    Access through TexSubImage2D and similar calls will notice the effect of
    the swap when they are not attached to framebuffer objects because
    GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SWAP_XY_MESA is associated with the framebuffer object and
    not the attachment points.

    The application should notice the display width and height are also swapped
    when GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SWAP_XY_MESA is GL_TRUE.

    This extension is mainly for pre-rotation and recommended to use it with
    MESA_framebuffer_flip_x and MESA_framebuffer_flip_y to have rotated
    result.
