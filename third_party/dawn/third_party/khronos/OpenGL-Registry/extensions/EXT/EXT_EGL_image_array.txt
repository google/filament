    OpenGL ES Extension #278

Dependencies

    OpenGL ES 2.0 is required
    OpenGL ES 3.0 affects the definition of this extension

    Requires EGL 1.2 and either the EGL_KHR_image or EGL_KHR_image_base
    extensions as well as OES_EGL_image.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification and
    the OES_EGL_image extension.

Overview

    This extension adds functionality to that provided by OES_EGL_image in
    order to support EGLImage 2D arrays. It extends the existing
    EGLImageTargetTexture2DOES entry point from OES_EGL_image. Render buffers
    are not extended to include array support.

    EGLImage 2D arrays can be created using extended versions of eglCreateImageKHR.
    For example, EGL_ANDROID_image_native_buffer can import image array native buffers
    on devices where such native buffers can be created.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens

    None.

Additions to Chapter 3 of the OpenGL ES 2.0 Specification

    In section 3.8.2 within the specification added by OES_EGL_Image:

        "Currently, <target> must be TEXTURE_2D or TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY."

Interactions with OpenGL ES 3.0  

    If the GL is not OpenGL ES 3.0 or above, references to TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY
    are omitted.

Errors

    GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated by EGLImageTargetTexture2DOES if
     <target> is not TEXTURE_2D or TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY

    GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated by EGLImageTargetTexture2DOES if
    <target> is not TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY and <image> has more than 1 layer.

Issues

    None.
