    OpenGL ES Extension #281

Dependencies

    Written against the OpenGL 4.5 and OpenGL ES 3.2 specifications

    GL_EXT_memory_object_fd requires GL_EXT_memory_object

    GL_EXT_semaphore_fd requires GL_EXT_semaphore

    Requires ARB_texture_storage or a version of OpenGL or OpenGL ES that
    incorporates it.

Overview

    Building upon the OpenGL memory object and semaphore framework
    defined in EXT_external_objects, this extension enables an OpenGL
    application to import a memory object or semaphore from POSIX file
    descriptor external handles.

New Procedures and Functions

    If the GL_EXT_memory_object_fd string is reported, the following
    commands are added:

    void ImportMemoryFdEXT(uint memory,
                           uint64 size,
                           enum handleType,
                           int fd);

    If the GL_EXT_semaphore_fd string is reported, the following commands
    are added:

    void ImportSemaphoreFdEXT(uint semaphore,
                              enum handleType,
                              int fd);


New Tokens

    The following tokens are added if either of the GL_EXT_memory_object_fd
    or GL_EXT_semaphore_fd strings are reported:

    Accepted by the <handleType> parameter of ImportMemoryFdEXT() or
    ImportSemaphoreFdEXT().

        HANDLE_TYPE_OPAQUE_FD_EXT                  0x9586

Additions to Chapter 4 of the OpenGL 4.5 Specification (Event Model)

    Add the following entry to table 4.2 "Commands for importing
    external semaphore handles."

        | Handle Type               | Import command       |
        +---------------------------+----------------------+
        | HANDLE_TYPE_OPAQUE_FD_EXT | ImportSemaphoreFdEXT |
        +---------------------------+----------------------+

    Replace the paragraph in section 4.2.1 beginning "External handles
    are often defined..." with the following

        The command

            ImportSemaphoreFdEXT(uint semaphore,
                                 enum handleType,
                                 int fd);

        imports a semaphore from the file descriptor <fd>.  What type of
        object <fd> refers to is determined by <handleType>.  A successful
        import operation transfers ownership of <fd> to the GL
        implementation, and performing any operation on <fd> in the
        application after an import results in undefined behavior.

Additions to Chapter 6 of the OpenGL 4.5 Specification (Memory Objects)

    Add the following entry to table 6.2 "Commands for importing
    external memory handles."

        | Handle Type               | Import command    |
        +---------------------------+-------------------+
        | HANDLE_TYPE_OPAQUE_FD_EXT | ImportMemoryFdEXT |
        +---------------------------+-------------------+

    Replace the paragraph in section 6.1 beginning "External handles are
    often defined..." with the following

        The command

            void ImportMemoryFdEXT(uint memory,
                                   uint64 size,
                                   enum handleType,
                                   int fd);

        imports a memory object of length <size> from the file descriptor
        <fd>.  What type of object <fd> refers to is determined by
        <handleType>.  A successful import operation transfers ownership
        of <fd> to the GL implementation, and performing any operation on
        <fd> in the application after an import results in undefined
        behavior.

Additions to Chapter 21 of the OpenGL 4.5 Specification (Special Functions)

    Add the following to section 21.4.1, Commands Not Usable in Display
    Lists.

    Under the "Memory Objects" section:

        ImportMemoryFdEXT

    Under the "GL command stream management" section:

        ImportSemaphoreFdEXT

Issues

    1)  Does this extension need to support importing Android/Linux
        sync FD handles?

        RESOLVED: No.  These are already usable in GL via extensions to the
        EGLSync mechanism.  Adding them here in order to support them in GLX
        contexts is not compelling enough to justify the additional effort.
