    OpenGL ES Extension #176

Dependencies

    OpenGL ES 3.0 or EXT_draw_buffers is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL ES 3.0 specification.

Overview

    This extension builds upon the EXT_draw_buffers extension.
    In EXT_draw_buffers (part of OpenGL ES 3.0), separate values could
    be written to each color buffer, but the blend enable, blend functions,
    blend equations and color write masks are global and apply to all color
    outputs.

    This extension provides the ability to independently
      * enable or disable blending,
      * set the blend equations,
      * set the blend functions, and
      * set the color write masks
    per color output.

    This extension introduces indexed versions of the enable,
    blend equation, blend function, and color mask commands, as
    well as associated indexed queries in order to control and
    query these states independently on a per-color output basis.

New Procedures and Functions

Additions to Chapter 2 of the OpenGL ES 3.0 Specification (OpenGL ES Operation)

    None.

Additions to Chapter 3 of the OpenGL ES 3.0 Specification (Rasterization)

    None.

Additions to Chapter 4 of the OpenGL ES 3.0 Specification (Per-Fragment
Operations and the Framebuffer)

    Modify the fifth paragraph of section 4.1.7 (Blending), p. 179, to
    read as follows:

    "Blending is enabled or disabled for an individual draw buffer with
    the commands:

        void EnableiEXT(enum target, uint index);
        void DisableiEXT(enum target, uint index);

    <target> is the symbolic constant BLEND and <index> is an integer
    <i> specifying the draw buffer associated with the symbolic constant
    DRAW_BUFFER<i>. Blending can be enabled or
    disabled for all draw buffers using Enable or Disable with the
    symbolic constant BLEND.  If blending is disabled for a particular
    draw buffer, proceed to the next operation."

    Modify section "Blend Equation" replacing the first paragraph beginning
    on p. 179, with the following:

    "Blending is controlled by the blend equation. This equation can be
    simultaneously set to the same value for all draw buffers using the
    commands:

       void BlendEquation(enum mode);
       void BlendEquationSeparate(enum modeRGB, enum modeAlpha);

    or for an individual draw buffer using the indexed commands:

        void BlendEquationiEXT(uint buf, enum mode);
        void BlendEquationSeparateiEXT(uint buf
                                       enum modeRGB,
                                       enum modeAlpha);

    BlendEquationSeparate and BlendEquationSeparateiEXT argument
    <modeRGB> determines the RGB blend equation while <modeAlpha>
    determines the alpha blend equation. BlendEquation and
    BlendEquationiEXT argument <mode> determines both the RGB and alpha
    blend equations. <mode>, <modeRGB>, and <modeAlpha> must be one of
    FUNC_ADD, FUNC_SUBTRACT, FUNC_REVERSE_SUBTRACT, MIN, MAX.
    BlendEquation and BlendEquationSeparate modify the blend equations
    for all draw buffers. BlendEquationiEXT and
    BlendEquationSeparateiEXT modify the blend equations associated with
    an individual draw buffer. The <buf> argument is an integer <i> that
    indicates that the blend equations should be modified for
    DRAW_BUFFER<i>."

    Modify section "Blend Functions" on p. 181, replacing the last sentence
    of the first paragraph and the second paragraph with the following:

    "Blend functions are simultaneously specified
    for all draw buffers using the commands:

        void BlendFunc(enum src, enum dst);
        void BlendFuncSeparate(enum srcRGB, enum dstRGB,
                               enum srcAlpha, enum dstAlpha);

    or for an individual draw buffer using the indexed commands:

        void BlendFunciEXT(uint buf, enum src, enum dst);
        void BlendFuncSeparateiEXT(uint buf, enum srcRGB,
                                   enum dstRGB, enum srcAlpha,
                                   enum dstAlpha);

    BlendFuncSeparate and BlendFuncSeparateiEXT arguments <srcRGB> and
    <dstRGB> determine the source and destination RGB blend functions,
    respectively, while <srcAlpha> and <dstAlpha> determine the source
    and destination alpha blend functions. BlendFunc and BlendFunciEXT
    argument <src> determines both RGB and alpha source functions, while
    <dst> determines both RGB and alpha destination functions.
    BlendFuncSeparate and BlendFunc modify the blend functions for all
    draw buffers. BlendFuncSeparateiEXT and BlendFunciEXT modify the
    blend functions associated with an individual draw buffer. The <buf>
    argument is an integer <i> that indicates that the blend equations
    should be modified for DRAW_BUFFER<i>."

    Modify section "Blending State" on p. 183, replacing the first two
    paragraphs with the following:

    "The state required for blending, for each draw buffer, is two
    integers for the RGB and alpha blend equations, four integers
    indicating the source and destination RGB and alpha blending
    functions, and a bit indicating whether blending is enabled or
    disabled. Additionally, four floating-point values to store the RGBA
    constant blend color are required.

    For all draw buffers, the initial blend equations for RGB and alpha
    are both FUNC_ADD, and the initial blending functions are ONE for
    the source RGB and alpha functions, and ZERO for the destination RGB
    and alpha functions. Initially, blending is disabled for all draw
    buffers. The initial constant blend color is (R,G,B,A) = (0,0,0,0).

    The value of the blend enable for draw buffer <i> can be queried by
    calling IsEnablediEXT with <target> BLEND and <index> <i>, and the
    values of the blend equations and functions can be queried by calling
    GetIntegeri_v with the corresponding <target> as shown in
    table 6.11 and <index> <i>.

    The value of the blend enable, or the blend equations and functions
    for draw buffer zero may also be queried by calling IsEnabled, or
    GetInteger, respectively, with the same symbolic constants but no
    <index> parameter."

    Modify section 4.2.2 (Fine Control of Buffer Updates) replacing the
    first two paragraphs as follows:

    "Writing to bits of each of the logical framebuffers after all
    per-fragment operations have been performed may be "masked". The
    commands:

        void ColorMask(boolean r, boolean g, boolean b, boolean a);
        void ColorMaskiEXT(uint buf, boolean r, boolean g,
                           boolean b, boolean a);

    control writes to the active draw buffers.

    ColorMask and ColorMaskiEXT are used to mask
    the writing of R, G, B and A values to the draw buffer or buffers.
    ColorMaskiEXT sets the mask for a particular draw buffer.
    The mask for DRAW_BUFFER<i> is modified by passing <i> as the parameter
    <buf>.  <r>, <g>, <b>, and <a> indicate whether R, G, B, or A
    values, respectively, are written or not (a value of TRUE means
    that the corresponding  value is written).  The mask specified by
    <r>, <g>, <b>, and <a> is applied to the color buffer associated
    with DRAW_BUFFER<i>.

    ColorMask sets the mask for all draw buffers to the same values as
    specified by <r>, <g>, <b>, and <a>.

    In the initial state, all color values are enabled for writing for all
    draw buffers.

    The value of the color writemask for draw buffer <i> can be queried
    by calling GetBooleani_v with <target> COLOR_WRITEMASK and <index>
    <i>.  The value of the color writemask for draw buffer zero may also be
    queried by calling GetBooleanv with the symbolic constant COLOR_WRITEMASK."

Additions to Chapter 5 of the OpenGL ES 3.0 Specification (Special Functions)

    None.

Additions to Chapter 6 of the OpenGL ES 3.0 Specification (State and
State Requests)

    Modify section 6.1.1 (Simple Queries) p. 226.

    Replace the 3rd paragraph with the following:

    "Finally,

        boolean IsEnabled(enum cap);

    can be used to determine if <cap> is currently enabled (as with
    Enable) or disabled, and

        boolean IsEnablediEXT(enum target, uint index);

    can be used to determine if the index state corresponding to
    <target> and <index> is enabled or disabled.

Additions to Appendix A of the OpenGL ES 3.0 Specification (Invariance)

    None.

Additions to the EGL/AGL/GLX/WGL Specifications

    None.

Errors

    The error INVALID_VALUE is generated by BlendEquationiEXT,
    BlendEquationSeparateiEXT, BlendFuncSeparateiEXT, and
    BlendFunciEXT if the <buf> parameter is outside the range
    [0, MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS-1].

    The error INVALID_VALUE is generated by GetIntegeri_v
    if <target> is BLEND_EQUATION_RGB, BLEND_EQUATION_ALPHA, BLEND_SRC_RGB,
    BLEND_SRC_ALPHA, BLEND_DST_RGB, BLEND_DST_ALPHA, and <index> is outside
    the range [0, MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS-1].

    The error INVALID_ENUM is generated by BlendFunciEXT
    if either <src>, or <dst> is not an accepted value.

    The error INVALID_ENUM is generated by BlendFuncSeparateiEXT
    if either <srcRGB>, <dstRGB>, <srcAlpha>, or <dstAlpha> is not
    an accepted value.

    The error INVALID_ENUM is generated if the <mode> parameter of
    BlendEquationiEXT is not one of FUNC_ADD, FUNC_SUBTRACT,
    FUNC_REVERSE_SUBTRACT, MAX, or MIN.

    The error INVALID_ENUM is generated if either the <modeRGB> or
    <modeAlpha> parameter of BlendEquationSeparateiEXT is not one of
    FUNC_ADD, FUNC_SUBTRACT, FUNC_REVERSE_SUBTRACT, MAX, or MIN.

    The error INVALID_ENUM is generated by EnableiEXT and
    DisableiEXT if the <target> parameter is not BLEND.

    The error INVALID_VALUE is generated by EnableiEXT and
    DisableiEXT if the <target> parameter is BLEND and the <index>
    parameter is outside the range [0, MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS-1].

    The error INVALID_ENUM is generated by IsEnablediEXT if the
    <target> parameter is not BLEND.

    The error INVALID_VALUE is generated by IsEnablediEXT if
    the <target> parameter is BLEND and the <index> parameter is
    outside the range [0, MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS-1].

    The error INVALID_VALUE is generated by ColorMaskiEXT
    if the <buf> parameter is outside the range[0, MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS-1].

    The error INVALID_VALUE is generated by GetBooleani_v if the <target>
    parameter is COLOR_WRITEMASK and the <index> parameter is outside the
    range [0, MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS-1].

Issues

    Note: these issues apply specifically to the definition of
    EXT_draw_buffers_indexed, which is based on the OpenGL EXT_draw_buffers2
    and ARB_draw_buffers_blend extensions as updated in OpenGL 4.x.
    Resolved issues from EXT_draw_buffers2 and ARB_draw_buffers_blend have
    been removed but remain largely applicable to this extension. These
    extensions can be found in the OpenGL Registry.

    (1) What functionality was removed from EXT_draw_buffers2 and
    ARB_draw_buffers_blend?

    - removed mention of multiple buffers being associated with DRAW_BUFFER<i>
    - removed mention of logical operation on color values
    - removed mention of the IndexMask command
    - removed errors related to glBegin/End

    (2) What functionality was changed or added relative to EXT_draw_buffers2
    and ARB_draw_buffers_blend?

    - use EnableiEXT/DisableiEXT instead of Enable/DisableIndexedEXT
    - use ColorMaskiEXT instead of ColorMaskIndexedEXT
    - use IsEnablediEXT instead of IsEnabledIndexedEXT
    - GetIntegeri_v is already in ES 3.0 and is re-used instead of adding
      GetIntegerIndexedvEXT.
    - GetBooleani_v is already in ES 3.1 and is re-used instead of adding
      GetBooleanIndexedvEXT
    - change the errors to be consistent and match GL 4.4.

    (3) What should we call this extension?

    RESOLVED: EXT_draw_buffers_indexed, because it adds the indexed "i"
    variants of all the draw buffer related state setting commands.
    Other options considered include:
    * EXT_draw_buffers2, EXT_draw_buffers_blend: both potentially confusing due
    to similarly named GL extensions, while this incorporates the functionality
    of both. Furthermore, this will likely be an EXT extension and there already
    is an EXT_draw_buffers2 in the GL registry. Using the same name and having
    different functionality is strongly discouraged.
    * EXT_draw_buffers_separate: because it allows separate control of the drawing
    buffers. Potentially could be confused with the "blend_func_separate" and
    "blend_equation_separate" extensions, which allow separately controlling a
    of the RGB and A equations and functions.
    * EXT_draw_buffers_independent: because it allows the functionality of the
    separate drawing buffers to be independently controlled.

    (4) Why doesn't this extension include GetBooleani_vEXT?

    RESOLVED: GetBooleani_v was added in OpenGL ES 3.1 per Bug 11326 and thus
    no longer needs to be added by this extension.  This extension does
    however extend the commands accepted by this core function.

    (5) What is the correct error for all the commands which take a <buf>
    or <index> parameter which should be in the range [0, MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS-1]?

    RESOLVED: INVALID_VALUE is the correct error.
    EXT_draw_buffers2 specified INVALID_OPERATION for the EnableIndexedEXT,
    DisableIndexedEXT, IsEnabledIndexedEXT, and GetBooleanIndexedvEXT commands.
    ARB_draw_buffers_blend specified INVALID_ENUM for the
    Blend{Equation Func}[Separate]iARB commands.
    OpenGL 4.4 specifies INVALID_VALUE for the core versions of all these
    commands. This was clarified by Bug 7705, but never propagated back to
    the ARB_draw_buffers_blend extension.  Since we are basing the
    functionality on the core versions of these commands we will use the
    GL 4.x error values.

    (6) What is the correct error for the Blend{Equation Func}[Separate]iEXT
    commands if mode/modeRGB/modeAlpha/srcRGB/srcAlpha/dstRGB/dstAlpha is
    not a legal value?

    RESOLVED. INVALID_ENUM. Some versions of the GL 4.4 spec said it should be
    INVALID_VALUE, but it seems that the more correct error value should
    INVALID_ENUM since all of these values are specified as 'enum' in the
    function signatures. This was clarified in Bug 11354.
