Specification Update Policy

    Khronos-approved extension specifications are updated in response to
    issues and bugs prioritized by the Khronos OpenGL Working Group. For
    extensions which have been promoted to a core Specification, fixes will
    first appear in the latest version of that core Specification, and will
    eventually be backported to the extension document. This policy is
    described in more detail at
        https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/docs/update_policy.php

Status

    Complete. Approved by the ARB on 2009/02/17.

Number

    ARB Extension #58

NOTE: Due to its size and complexity, this extension does not have its
own specification document. Instead, a forked version of the OpenGL 3.1
Specification including GL_ARB_compatibility language is downloadable
from the OpenGL Extension Registry at http://www.opengl.org/registry/.
Please refer to that specification for more information.
