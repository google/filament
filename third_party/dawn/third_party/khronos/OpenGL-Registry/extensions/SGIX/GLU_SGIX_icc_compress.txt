    SGIX_icc_texture is required.

Overview

    This extension provides a way to convert images to ICC formats
    since the GL does not have this capability.

Issues

    - What storage formats should we use?

    - Should we provide a decompression utility?

    - Would we be better off providing a general host-to-host copy
      mechanism?
