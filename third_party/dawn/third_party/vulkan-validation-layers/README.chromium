Description:
The Khronos Vulkan Validation Layers Components consist of the Vulkan
Validation Layers. The layers help validate Vulkan programs at runtime
for development. When enabled the Vulkan loader will hook the layers
into the Vulkan APIs so that they evaluate Vulkan API calls and flag
the incorrect use of the API with callbacks. The layers are essential
for developing Vulkan applications.
