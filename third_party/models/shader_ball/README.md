# ShaderBall
A shaderball asset with topology focused on Realtime Subdivision.

Over the past 2 years I have had the need for a permissively licensed shaderball with quad dominant topology as a result of performing research into PBR and realtime/interactive subdivision. 

At this time (March 2015), I am just starting a project where I hope to implement OpenSubDiv into Epic's Unreal Engine 4.

Mat Makin ( http://mathewmakin.com ) was kind enough to create this asset from scratch at my request after I spent some considerable time searching in vain for an equivalent mesh. 

It is inspired quite heavily by Epic's gorgeous shaderball, however, I must note that it is a from scratch reinterpretation focused on topology for subdivision research.

I felt that such an asset would be important to the rendering community and wish to release it into the public domain.

In the near future I will be adding a version with varying crease flags for OpenSubDiv: http://graphics.pixar.com/opensubdiv/docs/intro.html

I am hoping that if others find this asset useful that they will contact me with any changes to topology, textures, and UV layout. If you have changes that you wish to contribute, please contact me through my github account with an fbx file containing your changes. I will not be version controlling the asset, and will instead add any new shaderballs to an additional subdirectory.
