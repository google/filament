/*******************************************************************************
 *
 * Handling Structured Control Flow:
 *
 * Structured control flow guarantees that the CFG will reconverge at a given
 * point (the merge block). Within structured control flow, all blocks must be
 * post-dominated by the merge block, except return blocks and break blocks.
 * A break block is a block that branches to the innermost loop's merge block.
 *
 * Beyond this, we further assume that all unreachable blocks have been
 * cleanedup.  This means that the only unreachable blocks are those necessary
 * for valid structured control flow.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *
 * If a return is encountered, it should record that: i) the function has
 * "returned" and ii) the value of the return. The return should be replaced
 * with a branch. If current block is not within structured control flow, this
 * is the final return. This block should branch to the new return block (its
 * direct successor). If the current block is within structured control flow,
 * the branch destination should be the innermost loop's merge (if it exists)
 * or the merge block of the immediate structured control flow. If the merge
 * block produces any live values it will need to be predicated. While the merge
 * is nested in structured control flow, the predication path should branch to
 * the next best merge block available. Once structured control flow has been
 * exited, remaining blocks must be predicated with new structured control flow
 * (OpSelectionMerge). These should be nested correctly in case of straight line
 * branching to reach the final return block.
 *
 * In the final return block, the return value should be loaded and returned.
 * Memory promotion passes should be able to promote the newly introduced
 * variables ("has returned" and "return value").
 *
 * Predicating the Final Merge:
 *
 * At each merge block predication needs to be introduced (optimization: only if
 * that block produces value live beyond it). This needs to be done carefully.
 * The merge block should be split into multiple blocks.
 *
 *          1 (header)
 *        /   \
 * (ret) 2     3 (merge)
 *
 *         ||
 *         \/
 *
 *          1 (header)
 *        /   \
 *       2     |
 *        \   /
 *          3 (merge for 1, new header)
 *        /   \
 *       |     3 (old body)
 *        \   /
 *    (ret) 4 (new merge)
 *
 * In the above (simple) example, the return originally in |2| is passed through
 * the merge. That merge is predicated such that the old body of the block is
 * the else branch. The branch condition is based on the value of the "has
 * returned" variable. In more complicated examples (blocks between |1| and
 * |3|), the SSA would need to fixed up due the newly reconvergent path at the
 * merge for |1|. Assuming |3| originally was also a return block, the old body
 * of |3| should also store the return value for that case. The return value in
 * |4| just requires loading the return value variable.
