Changes from version 1.6.46 to version 1.6.47
---------------------------------------------

 * Modified the behaviour of colorspace chunks in order to adhere
   to the new precedence rules formulated in the latest draft of
   the PNG Specification.
   (Contributed by John Bowler)
 * Fixed a latent bug in `png_write_iCCP`.
   This would have been a read-beyond-end-of-malloc vulnerability,
   introduced early in the libpng-1.6.0 development, yet (fortunately!)
   it was inaccessible before the above-mentioned modification of the
   colorspace precedence rules, due to pre-existing colorspace checks.
   (Reported by Bob Friesenhahn; fixed by John Bowler)
