# By default libpng is built to use the __cdecl calling convention on

# the __watcall convention (compared with both MSVC and GCC which use __cdecl
# for library functions.)
#
# Thus the default must be changed to build on OpenWatcom and, once changed,
# the result will not be compatible with applications built using other
# compilers (in fact attempts to build will fail at compile time.)

$# The libpng project is incompletely configured.  To complete configuration
$# please complete the following steps:
$#
$#   1) Edit the 'before' rule of libpng.wpj (from the IDE) to define the
$#      locations of the zlib include file zlib.h and the built zlib library,
$#      zlib.lib.
$#
$#   2) If you want to change libpng to a non-standard configuration also
$#      change the definition of 'awk' in the before rule to the name of your
$#      awk command.  For more instructions on configuration read
$#      pngconfig.dfa.
$#
$#   3) Delete this file (config.inf).
<<
 @$(COPY) << pngconfig.dfa
$# pngconfig.dfa: this file contains configuration options for libpng.
$# If emtpy the standard configuration will be built.  For this file to be
$# used a working version of the program 'awk' is required and the program
$# must be identified in the 'before' rule of the project.
$#
$# If you don't already have 'awk', or the version of awk you have seems not
$# to work, download Brian Kernighan's awk (Brian Kernighan is the author of
$# awk.)  You can find source code and a built executable (called awk95.exe)
$# here:
$#
$#     http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/btl.mirror/
$#
$# The executable works just fine.
$#
$# If build issues errors after a change to pngconfig.dfa you have entered
$# inconsistent feature requests, or even malformed requests, in
$# pngconfig.dfa.  The error messages from awk should be comprehensible, but
$# if not simply go back to the start (nothing but comments in this file) and
$# enter configuration lines one by one until one produces an error.  (Or, of
$# course, do the standard binary chop.)
$#
$# You need to rebuild everything after a change to pnglibconf.dfa - i.e. you
$# must do Actions/Mark All Targets for Remake.  This is because the compiler
$# generated dependency information (as of OpenWatcom 1.9) does not record the
$# dependency on pnglibconf.h correctly.
$#
$# If awk isn't set then this file is bypassed.  If you just want the standard
$# configuration it is automatically produced from the distributed version
$# (scripts\pnglibconf.h.prebuilt) by editting PNG_API_RULE to 2 (to force use
$# of the OpenWatcom library calling convention.)
