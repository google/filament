    <!-- Place the name of the directory containing the source of zlib used for
	 debugging in this property.

         The directory need only contain the '.c' and '.h' files from the
	 source.

	 If you use a relative directory name (as below) then it must be
	 relative to the project directories; these are one level deeper than
	 the directories containing this file.

	 If the version of zlib you use does not match that used when the
	 distribution was built you will get warnings from pngtest that the zlib
	 versions do not match.  The zlib version used in this build is recorded

         signed by Microsoft.  This is therefore untested; only Microsoft can
