Two images (ftbbn0g01.png and ftbbn0g02.png) are by Glenn Randers-Pehrson, 2012

Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute these images for any
purpose and without fee is hereby granted.

The 15 "bas*.png" images are part of the much larger PngSuite test-set of
images, available for developers of PNG supporting software. The
complete set, available at http:/www.schaik.com/pngsuite/, contains
a variety of images to test interlacing, gamma settings, ancillary
chunks, etc.

The "ft*.png" images are "free/libre" replacements for the transparent
corresponding t*.png images in the PngSuite.

The "i*.png" images are the same images, but interlaced.

The images in this directory represent the basic PNG color-types:
grayscale (1-16 bit deep), full color (8 or 16 bit), paletted
(1-8 bit) and grayscale or color images with alpha channel. You
can use them to test the proper functioning of PNG software.
