# It isn't necessary to chose fixed or floating point for the APIs because the
# simplified API doesn't need fixed or floating point numbers.  It is necessary
# to chose an internal math implementation.  The default (because of 'everything
# = off') is fixed point - turn the floating point implementation on if you have
# hardware floating point or prefer your software floating point implementation.
option FLOATING_ARITHMETIC on

# This is not strictly necessary, but without it the message strings in the API
# will not be filled in
option ERROR_TEXT on

# Switching these options on enables the 'AFIRST' and 'BGR' formats - you don't
# need this if you don't use them, they just allow the in-memory layout to be
# changed to match common hardware formats.
