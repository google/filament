# Build libpng with basic read support.  This enables the lowest level libpng
# read API - the one where the calling code has to use a loop to read each row.
# At present this is the API used by most programs.
#
# Support is enabled only for those chunks and transformations that are
# typically required - others can be added easily.
#

everything = off

# The sequential read code is enabled here; the progressive code can be used
# instead but there is no point enabling both.

# Likewise it is pointless enabling both fixed and floating point APIs.  Choose
# one or the other for both the API and the internal math.

#Fixed point:
#option FIXED_POINT on
#option FLOATING_ARITHMETIC off

#Floating point:
option FLOATING_POINT on

# Basic error handling, IO and user memory support.  The latter allows the
# application program to provide its own implementations of 'malloc' and 'free'.

# To read the full set of PNG images correctly interlace, transparency and
# 16-bit support is required.  The application can implement interlace itself,
# but very few do and it's no longer possible to disable it when READ is
# enabled.
option READ_tRNS on
option READ_16BIT on

# Everything else is application dependent.  This file assumes the app handles
# all the native PNG bit layouts, so it doesn't need any of layout change
# transforms, but needs libpng to perform gamma correction.  It doesn't do any
# colorspace stuff and ignores the 'significant bit' information.
#
# If your app always expands the image to a limited set of bit layouts you
# probably want to consider using the simplified API instead of the low level
# one - see png.h and s_read.dfa.
