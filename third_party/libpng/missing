Run 'PROGRAM [ARGUMENT]...', returning a proper advice when this fails due
to PROGRAM being missing or too old.

Options:
  -h, --help      display this help and exit
  -v, --version   output version information and exit

Supported PROGRAM values:
aclocal autoconf autogen  autoheader autom4te automake autoreconf
bison   flex     help2man lex        makeinfo perl     yacc

Version suffixes to PROGRAM as well as the prefixes 'gnu-', 'gnu', and
'g' are ignored when checking the name.
