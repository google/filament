.SH NAME
png \- Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format

.SH DESCRIPTION
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is an extensible file format for the
lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images.  PNG
provides a patent-free replacement for GIF, and can also replace many
common uses of TIFF. Indexed-color, grayscale, and truecolor images are
supported, plus an optional alpha channel.  Sample depths range from
1 to 16 bits.
.br
PNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications, such
as the World Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a progressive
display option.  PNG is robust, providing both full file integrity
checking and fast, simple detection of common transmission errors.
Also, PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color
matching on heterogeneous platforms.
