This folder only contains SwiftShader's include directory, from Swiftshader's repository.

Swiftshader itself must be installed with it its libraries in a standard location.

If Swiftshader is installed is a non standard location, then the SWIFTSHADER_LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable must be set to specify that location.

Finally Swiftshader is enabled with the FILAMENT_USES_SWIFTSHADER=ON cmake option.


Example: install Swiftshader from source
----------------------------------------

    git clone https://github.com/google/swiftshader.git
    cd swiftshader/build
    cmake ..
    make -j

This will generate the following libraries:

    libEGL.dylib
    libGLESv2.dylib
    libvk_swiftshader.dylib

Either install those on your platform's standard library locations or set
SWIFTSHADER_LD_LIBRARY_PATH to where they are.

To update the 'include' directory, copy '../include' to 'third_party/swiftshader'.
