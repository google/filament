PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE
COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS

DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF

</blockquote>
<h3><em>Statement of Purpose</em></h3>
<p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world
automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights
(defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each
and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or
a database (each, a "Work").</p>
<p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights
to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of
creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the
public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works,
reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation
commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the
Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to
gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part
through the use and efforts of others.</p>
<p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and
without any expectation of additional consideration or
compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the
"Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects
to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work
under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.</p>
<p><strong>1. Copyright and Related Rights.</strong>
A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by
copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but
are not limited to, the following:
</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform,
display, communicate, and translate a Work;</li>
<li> moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
performer(s);</li>
<li>publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's
image or likeness depicted in a Work;</li>
<li>rights protecting against unfair competition in regards
to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a),
below;</li>
<li>rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and
reuse of data in a Work;</li>
<li>database rights (such as those arising under Directive
96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under
any national implementation thereof, including any amended
or successor version of such directive); and</li>
<li>other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights
throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and
any national implementations thereof.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2. Waiver.</strong> To the greatest extent
permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,
Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims
and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including
existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
(including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer
makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public
at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be
subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination,
or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
</p>
<p><strong>3. Public License Fallback.</strong> Should any
part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be
preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each
affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
(including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The
License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the
License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or
she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement
of Purpose.</p>
<p><strong>4. Limitations and Disclaimers.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
 <li>No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are
waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise
affected by this document.</li>
<li>Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no
representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including
without limitation warranties of title, merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the
absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present
or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.</li>
<li>Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of
other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof,
including without limitation any person's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims
responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
permissions or other rights required for any use of the
Work.</li>
<li>Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative
Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or
obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.</li>
