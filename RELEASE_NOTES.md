# Release notes

- Added a new, smaller, version of the `filamat` library, `filamat_lite`. Material optimization and
  compiling for non-OpenGL backends have been removed in favor of a smaller binary size.
- Implemented hard fences for the Metal backend, enablying dynamic resolution support.
- Improved `SurfaceOrientation` robustness when using UVs to generate tangents.
- Created a `RELEASE_NOTES.md` file, to be updated with significant PRs.
