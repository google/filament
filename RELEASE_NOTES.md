# Filament Release Notes log

This file contains one line summaries of commits that are worthy of mentioning in release notes.
A new header is inserted each time a *tag* is created.


# Release notes

- Added JNI bindings for the gltfio library.
- Fix support for parameter arrays in `.mat` files.
- Added support for `RGB_11_11_10`
- Removed support for `RGBM` (**warning:** source compatibility breakage)
- IBL cubemap can now be of any size

## sceneform-1.9pr3

- Added `Scene.addEntities()` to the Java / Kotlin bindings.
- Improved robustness in the tangents utility for meshes that have tangents *and* normals.
- Introduced `RenderTarget` API that allows View to reference an offscreen render target.
- Added `lucy_bloom` sample to demonstrate the new `RenderTarget` API.
- Added Screen Space Ambient Occlusion support (SAO)
- New blending modes: `multiply` and `screen`
- Fixed an issue when sorting blended objects with different blending modes
- The material property `curvatureToRoughness` has been replaced with `specularAntiAliasing`.
  This new specular anti-aliasing solution offers more control via two new properties:
  `specularAntiAliasingVariance` and `specularAntiAliasingThreshold`. They can also be set on
  material instances if needed
- Added specular ambient occlusion to compute a new AO term applied to specular reflections
  (see `specularAmbientOcclusion` property in materials)
- Added multi-bounce ambient occlusion to brighten AO and preserve local color
  (see `multiBounceAmbientOcclusion` property in materials)
- Micro-shadowing is now applied to material ambient occlusion
- Use a smaller 64x64 DFG LUT on mobile to reduce binary size
- Added a distance field generator to libimage.
- JavaScript MaterialInstance now supports vec4 colors.
- Further reduced `filamat` binary size by removing reliance on stdlib.
- Added a new, smaller, version of the `filamat` library, `filamat_lite`. Material optimization and
  compiling for non-OpenGL backends have been removed in favor of a smaller binary size.
- Implemented hard fences for the Metal backend, enablying dynamic resolution support.
- Improved `SurfaceOrientation` robustness when using UVs to generate tangents.
- Created a `RELEASE_NOTES.md` file, to be updated with significant PRs.
