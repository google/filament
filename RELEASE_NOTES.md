# Filament Release Notes log

This file contains one line summaries of commits that are worthy of mentioning in release notes.
A new header is inserted each time a *tag* is created.

## Next release

## v1.7.0

- MaterialInstances now have optional names.
- JNI constructors are now "package private" unless they take an Engine.

## v1.6.0

- gltfio: fixed incorrect cone angles with lights.
- Specular ambient occlusion now offers 3 modes: off, simple (default on desktop) and bent normals.
  The latter is more accurate but more expensive and requires a bent normal to be specified in the
  material. If selected and not bent normal is specified, Filament falls back to the simple mode.
- Specular ambient occlusion from bent normals now smoothly disappears as roughness goes from 0.3
  to 0.1. Specular ambient occlusion can completely remove specular light which looks bad on glossy
  metals. Use the simple specular occlusion mode for glossy metals instead.
- Refraction can now be set on `MaterialBuilder` from Java.
- Refraction mode and type can now be set by calling `MaterialBuilder::refractionMode()`.
  and `MaterialBuilder::refractionType()` instad of `materialRefraction()` and
  `materialRefractionType()` (️⚠️ **API change**).
- Fixed documentation confusion about focused spot vs spot lights.
- Fixed a race condition in the job system.
- Fixed support for 565 bitmaps on Android.
- Added support for timer queries in the Metal backend.
- Improved dynamic resolution implementation to be more accurate and target more platforms.
- `beginFrame()` now accepts a v-sync timestamp for accurate frame time measurement (used for
  frame skipping and dynamic resolution). You can pass `0` to get the old behavior (⚠️ **API change**).
- Fixed several issues related to multi-view support: removed
  `View::setClearColor()`, a similar functionality is now handled by `Renderer::setClearOptions()`
  and `Skybox`, the later now can be set to a constant color (⚠️ **API breakage**).
- Fixed spot/point lights rendering bug depending on Viewport position.
- Textures can now be swizzled.
- The emissive property of materials is now expressed in nits and the alpha channel contains the
  exposure weight (at 0.0 the exposure is not applied to the emissive component of a surface, at
  1.0 the exposure is applied just like with any regular light) (⚠️ **API breakage**).
- Added new `intensityCandela` and `setIntensityCandela` API to `LightManager` for setting a punctual
  light's intensity in candela.
- Fixed an issue where some `ShadowOptions` were not being respected when passed to
  `LightManager::Builder`.
- Added a Depth of Field post-processing effect

## v1.5.2
