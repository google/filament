**Vulkan Backend**
          *Last updated: 26 October 2022*

![](../../docs/images/filament_logo.png)

-----

This document is a high-level "state of the union" for Filament's Vulkan backend. Some of the
details may be out of date by the time you read it, but we hope to keep it reasonably well
maintained, which is why it lives as a markdown document in our source tree.

# Architecture

At a high level, the Vulkan backend is composed of the **driver**, a set of **helpers**, and
a set of **handle types**.

The driver is responsible for implementing all `DriverAPI` entry points, as well as managing a
single `VkDevice` and `VkInstance`.

# Overview

## VulkanDriver and VulkanContext

The `VulkanDriver` class is the bridge between the backend and the Filament engine, and is kept as
minimal as possible. Most of the actual logic is contained in methods in `VulkanContext` and in the
handle types rather than directly in `VulkanDriver`.

In a self-imposed design constraint, we have decided that every method in `VulkanDriver` must be an
override; it should have no private methods other than the handle allocators. This reins in
complexity because it must implement every method in `DriverAPI` while dealing with Vulkan itself,
which has an extremely low-level API.

## Command buffers

The `VulkanCommands` class creates command buffers on the fly and maintains a chain of semaphores
to ensure that submitted command buffers are executed serially.

## Handle types

This sole purpose of `VulkanHandles.h` is to declare structs that descend from the hardware handles
that are defined in `DriverBase.h`.

Most of the handle types do not contain much logic, but they often do more than mere wrapping of
Vk objects. Notably, `VulkanRenderTarget` does not have a straightforward mapping to any one Vk
object. See its class comment for details. Also, `VulkanTexture` and `VulkanSwapChain` have their
own cpps file because of complexity around layouts and subresources.

VulkanProgram
: Descends from `HwProgram`, owns a pair of `VkShaderModule`.

VulkanRenderTarget
: Descends from `HwRenderTarget`, contains references to `VulkanTexture` objects.

VulkanSwapChain
: Descends from `HwSwapChain`, has a reference to `VkSurfaceKHR` and `VkSwapchainKHR`.

VulkanVertexBuffer
: Descends from `HwVertexBuffer`, owns a set of `VkBuffer`.

VulkanIndexBuffer
: Descends from `HwIndexBuffer`, owns a `VkBuffer`.

VulkanSamplerGroup
: Descends from `HwSamplerGroup`, does not own Vk objects.

VulkanTexture
: Descends from `HwTexture`, owns a `VkImage` and a set of `VkImageLayout`.

VulkanRenderPrimitive
: Descends from `HwRenderPrimitive`, does not own Vk objects.

One special case is `VulkanBuffer`, which is not a handle class. It encapulates functionality shared
between `VulkanIndexBuffer` and `VulkanVertexBuffer`.

## Helpers

`VulkanDriver` owns one instance of each helper. They are not part of a class hierarchy but
they do follow a common set of conventions. For example, most of them implement a `gc()` method
that is called once per frame to free unused objects.

VulkanPipelineCache
: Cache of VkDescriptorSet, VkPipeline, and VkPipelineLayout.

VulkanDisposer
: Holds reference counts to Vulkan objects in order to defer their destruction.

VulkanFboCache
: Cache of VkRenderPass and VkFramebuffer. Contains weak references to VkImage handles, but does not
  own any pixel data. The cache key for render passes is quite complex because it needs to include
  image layout information in a compact way. For details see the comments in the `RenderPassKey`
  declaration.

VulkanStagePool
: Pool of VkBuffer objects that can be memory mapped (shared between host and device).

VulkanSamplerCache
: This is our simplest cache object because Vulkan samplers are fairly lightweight and re-usable.

## Folder layout and namespacing

With the exception of BlueVK, all Vulkan-specific code lives in `backend/src/vulkan`, which has
no subfolders. All backend-specific types and functions live directly in the `filament::backend`
namespace, and we simply prefix our names with "Vulkan" when necessary to avoid ambiguation with
OpenGL.

# Image Layout Strategy

Adhering to a coherent strategy for image layout transitions is crucial. Without this, validation
errors (and actual black screens with some GPU vendors) occur far too easily and can feel like
whack-a-mole.

Vulkan provides several mechanisms for transitioning layout (render passes, barriers) so the
strategy outlined below specifies which mechanism should be used in various scenarios.

The current image layouts are tracked at the subresource level in `VulkanTexture` using a
specialized STL-ish container that we designed for this purpose:
[RangeMap](https://github.com/google/filament/blob/main/libs/utils/include/utils/RangeMap.h).

In the past we tried to avoid tracking since it theoritically duplicates state that exists in the
GPU vendor's driver. However in practice this was impossible to manage, because complex logic was
required to deduce the current layout. Also, tracking lets us use `assert_invariant` in many places
to ensure that the behavior described in this document is implemented properly.  It is much easier
to catch errors with asserts than with validation.

As of this writing, the current rules are:

(1) **Read-Only Color Textures**

These should be created in an UNDEFINED state and stay that way until data gets uploaded into them,
at which point the appropriate subresources are transitioned to TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL for the upload,
then to SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL, both times using a barrier.  Note that a subresource might be
updated several times; each time it undergoes these two transitions.

If a shader samples from a texture whose mipmaps are only partially loaded, we might see validation
warnings about how some subresources are in an UNDEFINED layout.  However if we are properly using
the `createTextureView` driver API, then the Vulkan backend will not bind those particular
subresources, so validation should not complain.

(2) **Writeable Color Textures**

During construction of the HwTexture, these are transitioned to GENERAL using a barrier.

GENERAL layout is not recommended by AMD best practices but in our case we wish to avoid thrashing
the layout between COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL and SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL for post-processing
effects.  Moreover we do not have a priori knowledge about blitting and read pixels usage.

(3) **Depth Textures**

During construction of the HwTexture, these are transitioned to GENERAL using a barrier.

Note that some post-processing passes (e.g. SSAO) sample from the depth buffer while also enabling
depth testing. Using GENERAL makes this legal.

(4) **Swap Chain Textures**

During construction, these are transitioned to GENERAL using a barrier. They are then transitioned
to PRESENT at the end of the frame using a barrier, and transitioned back to GENERAL using the first
render pass of the frame.

Note that we transition to PRESENT using a barrier, but with some GPU vendors it might be preferable
to transition them using the last render pass. However we have no way of knowing ahead of time which
pass is last.

Note that Filament allows swap chains to be used as blit targets and blit sources (e.g. for
ReadPixels). Using GENERAL makes this easier to manage.

(5) **Headless Swap Chain Textures**

These follow the same rules as writeable color texture and depth textures.

# VulkanPipelineCache

Uniforms, samplers, and shaders are not directly bindable in Vulkan; instead they are bound through
indirection layers called *pipelines* and *descriptor sets*. The `VulkanPipelineCache` class allows
the driver to call methods that are conceptually simple like `bindUniformBuffer`, even though no
such function exists in the low-level Vulkan API.

Although it is actually just another cache manager, `VulkanPipelineCache` has a fairly rich set of
public methods. See its header file for details.

The pipeline cache also manages the *layout objects*, which constrain the number of uniform buffers
and samplers that can be bound simultaneously (see `VkDescriptorSetLayout` and `VkPipelineLayout`).

# Memory Allocation

Some architectures (e.g. Adreno) only allow a small number of `VkDeviceMemory` objects to exist at
once, so we consolidate these using a simple third-party library
([vk_mem_alloc](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)). This library is
used each time the backend needs to create a `VkBuffer` or `VkImage`. See `VulkanStagePool` for a
usage example.

# BlueVK

BlueVK loads in functions for all Vulkan entry points and supported extensions. On Android, this
is not absolutely necessary since core functionality is available through static linking. However,
we found that in practice it is simpler to use BlueVK across all platforms because of its ability
to load extensions.

The BlueVK C++ source is generated from a Python script that consumes `vk.xml`. This XML file is an
API specification maintained by Khronos on GitHub.

None of the source files in the  Vulkan backend include `vulkan.h` directly,  instead they include
the BlueVK header, which in turn includes the Vulkan headers.

!!! Note
    Each time we update BlueVK by feeding it the latest `vk.xml`, we should also update the
    Vulkan headers that are checked in to `libs/bluevk/include/vulkan`. If BlueVK and the Vulkan
    headers are not updated concurrently, this will cause build errors.

# Top Issues

Here we list some of the most significant issues and to-be-done items for the Vulkan backend.

- Improve the UBO strategy
    - Currently we use staging buffers and perform lots of copies (host-to-host, then host-to-device)
    - Consider an approach similar to MetalDriver, which effectively implements double-buffering
      using a pool of shared mem buffers
- Consider using subpasses for the depth prepass
- We lazily create pipeline objects
        1. This is notoriously slow in Vulkan
        2. We do lots of state hashing for this
        3. Vulkan has special pipeline cache objects that we aren't using yet, but...
        4. It might be better to enhance our driver API to allow a priori construction
- We need more automated testing
- We don't *quite* have feature parity with the OpenGL backend
    - No support for streaming camera texture yet
        - This is possible, even in Android O, just haven't gotten around to it yet
