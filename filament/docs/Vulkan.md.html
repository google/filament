**Vulkan Backend**
          *Last updated: 6 Feb 2019*

![](../../docs/images/filament_logo.png)

-----

This document is a high-level "state of the union" for Filament's Vulkan backend. Some of the
details may be out of date by the time you read it, but we hope to keep it reasonably well
maintained, which is why it lives as a markdown document in our source tree.

# Architecture

At a high level, the Vulkan backend is composed of the **driver**, a set of **cache managers**, and
a set of **handle types**.

The driver is responsible for implementing all `DriverAPI` entry points, as well as managing a
single `VkDevice` and `VkInstance`.

One of the handle types is the **swap chain**. This is a significant component because it owns the
command buffers that we use to issue draw calls to Vulkan. We allow applications to create multiple
swap chain objects, but in practice the swap chain is basically a singleton.

# Overview

## VulkanDriver and VulkanContext

The `VulkanDriver` class is the bridge between the backend and the Filament engine, and is kept as
minimal as possible. Most of the actual logic is contained in methods in `VulkanContext` and in the
handle types rather than directly in `VulkanDriver`.

In a self-imposed design constraint, we have decided that every method in `VulkanDriver` must be an
override; it should have no private methods other than the handle allocators. This reins in
complexity because it must implement every method in `DriverAPI` while dealing with Vulkan itself,
which has an extremely low-level API.

## Command buffers

We persist one `VkCommandBuffer` for each element in the swap context. This allows us to
populate command buffer "A" while the GPU is busy consuming command buffer "B".

Note that we can receive DriverAPI requests before the SwapChain has been created. One typical
example is uploading texture data. For these types of operations, we use a secondary "work" command
buffer.

## Handle types

This sole purpose of `VulkanHandles.h` is to declare structs that descend from the hardware handles
that are defined in `DriverBase.h`.

Most of the handle types do not contain much logic, but they often do more than mere wrapping of
Vk objects. Notably, `VulkanRenderTarget` does not have a straightforward mapping to any one Vk
object. See its class comment for details.

VulkanProgram
: Descends from `HwProgram`, owns a pair of `VkShaderModule`.

VulkanRenderTarget
: Descends from `HwRenderTarget`, contains references to `VkImage` objects.

VulkanSwapChain
: Descends from `HwSwapChain`, owns `VulkanSurfaceContext` which has a reference to `VkSurfaceKHR`
  and `VkSwapchainKHR`.

VulkanVertexBuffer
: Descends from `HwVertexBuffer`, owns a set of `VkBuffer`.

VulkanIndexBuffer
: Descends from `HwIndexBuffer`, owns a `VkBuffer`.

VulkanUniformBuffer
: Descends from `HwUniformBuffer`, owns a `VkBuffer`.

VulkanSamplerGroup
: Descends from `HwSamplerGroup`, does not own Vk objects.

VulkanTexture
: Descends from `HwTexture`, owns a `VkImage` and `VkImageLayout`.

VulkanRenderPrimitive
: Descends from `HwRenderPrimitive`, does not own Vk objects.

One special case is `VulkanBuffer`, which is not a handle class. It encapulates functionality shared
between `VulkanIndexBuffer` and `VulkanVertexBuffer`.

## Cache managers

`VulkanDriver` owns one instance of each cache manager. They are not part of a class hierarchy but
they do follow a common set of conventions. For example, most of them implement a `gc()` method
that is called once per frame to free unused objects.

VulkanBinder
: Cache of VkDescriptorSet and VkPipeline.

VulkanFboCache
: Cache of VkRenderPass and VkFramebuffer. Contains weak references to VkImage handles, but does not
  own any pixel data.

VulkanStagePool
: Pool of VkBuffer objects that can be memory mapped (shared between host and device).

VulkanSamplerCache
: This is our simplest cache object because Vulkan samplers are fairly lightweight and re-usable.

## Folder layout and namespacing

With the exception of BlueVK, all Vulkan-specific code lives in `filament/driver/vulkan`, which has
no subfolders. All backend-specific types and functions live directly in the `filament::driver`
namespace, and we simply prefix our names with "Vulkan" when necessary to avoid ambiguation with
OpenGL.

# VulkanBinder

Uniforms, samplers, and shaders are not directly bindable in Vulkan; instead they are bound through
indirection layers called *pipelines* and *descriptor sets*. The `VulkanBinder` class allows
the driver to call methods that are conceptually simple like `bindUniformBuffer`, even though no
such function exists in the low-level Vulkan API.

Although it is actually just another cache manager, `VulkanBinder` has a fairly rich set of public
methods. See its header file for details.

In the interest of simplicity, the binder never mutates descriptor sets (see
`vkUpdateDescriptorSets`) except upon creation. Doing so would either require the use of
synchronization primitives, or require double-buffering for all descriptors.

!!! Note
    Our approach to descriptor sets is similar to what Unreal does, but different from bgfx, which
    calls vkUpdateDescriptorSets on every frame in order to point them to a new range within a
    monolithic UBO. To avoid synchronization issues, bgfx creates a separate descriptor pool for
    each element of the swap chain.

The binder also manages the *layout objects*, which constrain the number of uniform buffers and
samplers that can be bound simultaneously (see `VkDescriptorSetLayout` and `VkPipelineLayout`). Here
we take advantage of Filament's opinionated shading model in order to keep things simple, which
allows us to create only one layout for the entire lifetime of the app.

# Memory Allocation

Some architectures (e.g. Adreno) only allow a small number of `VkDeviceMemory` objects to exist at
once, so we consolidate these using a simple third-party library
([vk_mem_alloc](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)). This library is
used each time the backend needs to create a `VkBuffer` or `VkImage`. See `VulkanStagePool` for a
usage example.

!!! Warning
    vk_mem_alloc proffers a defrag function which we are not calling anywhere yet. This will likely
    be necessary to avoid running up against memory limitations.

# BlueVK

BlueVK loads in functions for all Vulkan entry points and supported extensions. On Android, this
is not absolutely necessary since core functionality is available through static linking. However,
we found that in practice it is simpler to use BlueVK across all platforms because of its ability
to load extensions.

The BlueVK C++ source is generated from a Python script that consumes `vk.xml`. This XML file is an
API specification maintained by Khronos on GitHub.

None of the source files in the  Vulkan backend include `vulkan.h` directly,  instead they include
the BlueVK header, which in turn includes the Vulkan headers.

!!! Note
    Each time we update BlueVK by feeding it the latest `vk.xml`, we should also update the
    Vulkan headers that are checked in to `libs/bluevk/include/vulkan`. If BlueVK and the Vulkan
    headers are not updated concurrently, this will cause build errors.

# Top Issues

Here we list some of the most significant issues and to-be-done items for the Vulkan backend.

- We need to do more performance analysis
    - We don't have great stress tests, but we should at least:
        1. Try sponza on a Pixel 2
        2. Capture a systrace
        3. Compare with GL
- We lazily create pipeline objects
        1. This is notoriously slow in Vulkan
        2. We do lots of state hashing for this
        3. Vulkan has special pipeline cache objects that we aren't using yet, but...
        4. It might be better to enhance our driver API to allow a priori construction
- We create a large number of descriptor sets
    - Might be hard to avoid
    - We should look into dynamic uniforms
- We might be able to improve our UBO strategy
    - Currently we use staging buffers and perform lots of host-to-device copies
    - Some engines (e.g. bgfx) use always-mapped shared memory instead
- We have no automated tests
- We don't *quite* have feature parity with the OpenGL backend
    - No support for streaming camera texture yet
        - This is possible, even in Android O, just haven't gotten around to it yet
    - Filament fences don't map well to Vulkan semantics
        - Higher level timing queries might make more sense
