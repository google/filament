/**
 * A generic interface to dispatch callbacks.
 *
 * All APIs that take a callback as argument also take a
 * CallbackHandler* which is used to dispatch the
 * callback: CallbackHandler::post() method is called from a service thread as soon
 * as possible (this will NEVER be the main thread), CallbackHandler::post()
 * is  responsible for scheduling the callback onto the thread the
 * user desires.
 *
 * This is intended to make callbacks interoperate with
 * the platform/OS's own messaging system.
 *
 * CallbackHandler* can always be nullptr in which case the default handler is used. The
 * default handler always dispatches callbacks on filament's main thread opportunistically.
 *
 * Life time:
 * ---------
 *
 * Filament make no attempts to manage the life time of the CallbackHandler* and never takes
 * ownership.
 * In particular, this means that the CallbackHandler instance must stay valid until all
 * pending callbacks are been dispatched.
 *
 * Similarly, when shutting down filament, care must be taken to ensure that all pending callbacks
 * that might access filament's state have been dispatched. Filament can no longer ensure this
 * because callback execution is the responsibility of the CallbackHandler, which is external to
 * filament.
 * Typically, the concrete CallbackHandler would have a mechanism to drain and/or wait for all
 * callbacks to be processed.
