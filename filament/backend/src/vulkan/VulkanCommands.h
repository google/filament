// Manages a set of command buffers and semaphores, exposing an API that is significantly simpler
// than the raw Vulkan API.
//
// The manager's API primarily consists of get() and flush(). The "get" method acquires a fresh
// command buffer in the recording state, while the "flush" method releases a command buffer and
// changes its state from recording to executing. Some of the operational details are listed below.
//
// - Manages a dependency chain of submitted command buffers using VkSemaphore.
//    - This creates a guarantee of in-order execution.
//    - Semaphores are recycled to prevent create / destroy churn.
//
// - Notifies listeners when recording begins in a new VkCommandBuffer.
//    - Used by PipelineCache so that it knows when to clear out its shadow state.
//
// - Allows 1 user to inject a "dependency" semaphore that stalls the next flush.
//    - This is used for asynchronous acquisition of a swap chain image, since the GPU
//      might require a valid swap chain image when it starts executing the command buffer.
//
// - Allows 1 user to listen to the most recent flush event using a "finished" VkSemaphore.
//    - This is used to trigger presentation of the swap chain image.
//
// - Allows off-thread queries of command buffer status.
//    - Exposes an "updateFences" method that transfers current fence status into atomics.
//    - Users can examine these atomic variables (see VulkanCmdFence) to determine status.
//    - We do this because vkGetFenceStatus must be called from the rendering thread.
