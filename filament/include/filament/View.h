 *  - The Scene
 *  - The Camera
 *  - The Viewport
 *  - Some rendering parameters
 *
 * \note
 * View instances are heavy objects that internally cache a lot of date needed for Rendering.

 *
 * For example, in a game, a View could be used for the main scene and another one for the
 * game's user interface. More View instances could be used for creating special effects (e.g.
