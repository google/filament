 * A Renderer instance represents an operating system's window.

 * A Renderer is created using Engine.createRenderer() and destroyed using

    /**
     * Returns the time in second of the last call to beginFrame(). This value is constant for all
     * views rendered during a frame. The epoch is set with resetUserTime().
     *
     * In materials, this value can be queried using `vec4 getUserTime()`. The value returned
     * is a highp vec4 encoded as follows:
     *
     *      time.x = (float)Renderer.getUserTime();
     *      time.y = Renderer.getUserTime() - time.x;
     *
     * It follows that the following invariants are true:
     *
     *      (double)time.x + (double)time.y == Renderer.getUserTime()
     *      time.x == (float)Renderer.getUserTime()
     *
     * This encoding allows the shader code to perform high precision (i.e. double) time
     * calculations when needed despite the lack of double precision in the shader, for e.g.:
     *
     *      To compute (double)time * vertex in the material, use the following construct:
     *
     *              vec3 result = time.x * vertex + time.y * vertex;
     *
     *
     * Most of the time, high precision computations are not required, but be aware that the
     * precision of time.x rapidly diminishes as time passes:
     *
     *          time    | precision
     *          --------+----------
     *          16.7s   |    us
     *          4h39    |    ms
     *         77h      |   1/60s
     *
     *
     * In other words, it only possible to get microsecond accuracy for about 16s or millisecond
     * accuracy for just under 5h.
     *
     * This problem can be mitigated by calling resetUserTime(), or using high precision time as
     * described above.
     *
     * @return The time is seconds since resetUserTime() was last called.
