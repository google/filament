/**
 * TransformManager is used to add transform components to entities.
 *
 * A Transform component gives an entity a position and orientation in space in the coordinate
 * space of its parent transform. The TransformManager takes care of computing the world-space
 * transform of each component (i.e. its transform relative to the root).
 *
 * Creation and destruction
 * ========================
 *
 * A transform component is created using TransformManager::create() and destroyed by calling
 * TransformManager::destroy().
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
 *  filament::Engine* engine = filament::Engine::create();
 *  utils::Entity object = utils::EntityManager.get().create();
 *
 *  auto& tcm = engine->getTransformManager();
 *
 *  // create the transform component
 *  tcm.create(object);
 *
 *  // set its transform
 *  auto i = tcm.getInstance(object);
 *  tcm.setTransform(i, mat4f::translation({ 0, 0, -1 }));
 *
 *  // destroy the transform component
 *  tcm.destroy(object);
