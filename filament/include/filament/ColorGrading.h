/**
 * ColorGrading is used to transform (either to modify or correct) the colors of the HDR buffer
 * rendered by Filament. Color grading transforms are applied after lighting, and after any lens
 * effects (bloom for instance), and include tone mapping.
 *
 * Creation, usage and destruction
 * ===============================
 *
 * A ColorGrading object is created using the ColorGrading::Builder and destroyed by calling
 * Engine::destroy(const ColorGrading*). A ColorGrading object is meant to be set on a View.
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
 *  filament::Engine* engine = filament::Engine::create();
 *
 *  filament::ColorGrading* colorGrading = filament::ColorGrading::Builder()
 *              .toneMapping(filament::ColorGrading::ToneMapping::ACES)
 *              .build(*engine);
 *
 *  myView->setColorGrading(colorGrading);
 *
 *  engine->destroy(colorGrading);
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Performance
 * ===========
 *
 * Creating a new ColorGrading object may be more expensive than other Filament objects as a
 * 3D LUT may need to be generated. The generation of a 3D LUT, if necessary, may happen on
 * the CPU.
 *
 * Ordering
 * ========
 *
 * The various transforms held by ColorGrading are applied in the following order:
 * - Exposure
 * - Night adaptation
 * - White balance
 * - Channel mixer
 * - Shadows/mid-tones/highlights
 * - Slope/offset/power (CDL)
 * - Contrast
 * - Vibrance
 * - Saturation
 * - Curves
 * - Tone mapping
 * - Luminance scaling
 * - Gamut mapping
 *
 * Defaults
 * ========
 *
 * Here are the default color grading options:
 * - Exposure: 0.0
 * - Night adaptation: 0.0
 * - White balance: temperature 0, and tint 0
 * - Channel mixer: red {1,0,0}, green {0,1,0}, blue {0,0,1}
 * - Shadows/mid-tones/highlights: shadows {1,1,1,0}, mid-tones {1,1,1,0}, highlights {1,1,1,0},
 *   ranges {0,0.333,0.550,1}
 * - Slope/offset/power: slope 1.0, offset 0.0, and power 1.0
 * - Contrast: 1.0
 * - Vibrance: 1.0
 * - Saturation: 1.0
 * - Curves: gamma {1,1,1}, midPoint {1,1,1}, and scale {1,1,1}
 * - Tone mapping: ACESLegacyToneMapper
 * - Luminance scaling: false
 * - Gamut mapping: false
 * - Output color space: Rec709-sRGB-D65
 *
