/**
 * Camera represents the eye through which the scene is viewed.
 *
 * A Camera has a position and orientation and controls the projection and exposure parameters.
 *
 * Creation and destruction
 * ========================
 *
 * In Filament, Camera is a component that must be associated with an entity. To do so,
 * use Engine::createCamera(Entity). A Camera component is destroyed using
 * Engine::destroyCameraComponent(Entity).
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
 *  filament::Engine* engine = filament::Engine::create();
 *
 *  utils::Entity myCameraEntity = utils::EntityManager::get().create();
 *  filament::Camera* myCamera = engine->createCamera(myCameraEntity);
 *  myCamera->setProjection(45, 16.0/9.0, 0.1, 1.0);
 *  myCamera->lookAt({0, 1.60, 1}, {0, 0, 0});
 *  engine->destroyCameraComponent(myCamera);
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 *
 * Coordinate system
 * =================
 *
 * The camera coordinate system defines the *view space*. The camera points towards its -z axis
 * and is oriented such that its top side is in the direction of +y, and its right side in the
 * direction of +x.
 *
 * @note
 * Since the *near* and *far* planes are defined by the distance from the camera,
 * their respective coordinates are -\p distance(near) and -\p distance(far).
 *
 * Clipping planes
 * ===============
 *
 * The camera defines six *clipping planes* which together create a *clipping volume*. The
 * geometry outside this volume is clipped.
 *
 * The clipping volume can either be a box or a frustum depending on which projection is used,
 * respectively Projection.ORTHO or Projection.PERSPECTIVE. The six planes are specified either
 * directly or indirectly using setProjection().
 *
 * The six planes are:
 * - left
 * - right
 * - bottom
 * - top
 * - near
 * - far
 *
 * @note
 * To increase the depth-buffer precision, the *far* clipping plane is always assumed to be at
 * infinity for rendering. That is, it is not used to clip geometry during rendering.
 * However, it is used during the culling phase (objects entirely behind the *far*
 * plane are culled).
 *
 *
 * Choosing the *near* plane distance
 * ==================================
 *
 * The *near* plane distance greatly affects the depth-buffer resolution.
 *
 * Example: Precision at 1m, 10m, 100m and 1Km for various near distances assuming a 32-bit float
 * depth-buffer:
 *
 *    near (m)  |   1 m  |   10 m  |  100 m   |  1 Km
 *  -----------:|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|:--------:
 *      0.001   | 7.2e-5 |  0.0043 |  0.4624  |  48.58
 *      0.01    | 6.9e-6 |  0.0001 |  0.0430  |   4.62
 *      0.1     | 3.6e-7 |  7.0e-5 |  0.0072  |   0.43
 *      1.0     |    0   |  3.8e-6 |  0.0007  |   0.07
 *
 *  As can be seen in the table above, the depth-buffer precision drops rapidly with the
 *  distance to the camera.
 *
 * Make sure to pick the highest *near* plane distance possible.
 *
 * On Vulkan and Metal platforms (or OpenGL platforms supporting either EXT_clip_control or
 * ARB_clip_control extensions), the depth-buffer precision is much less dependent on the *near*
 * plane value:
 *
 *    near (m)  |   1 m  |   10 m  |  100 m   |  1 Km
 *  -----------:|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|:--------:
 *      0.001   | 1.2e-7 |  9.5e-7 |  7.6e-6  |  6.1e-5
 *      0.01    | 1.2e-7 |  9.5e-7 |  7.6e-6  |  6.1e-5
 *      0.1     | 5.9e-8 |  9.5e-7 |  1.5e-5  |  1.2e-4
 *      1.0     |    0   |  9.5e-7 |  7.6e-6  |  1.8e-4
 *
 *
 * Choosing the *far* plane distance
 * =================================
 *
 * The far plane distance is always set internally to infinity for rendering, however it is used for
 * culling and shadowing calculations. It is important to keep a reasonable ratio between
 * the near and far plane distances. Typically a ratio in the range 1:100 to 1:100000 is
 * commanded. Larger values may causes rendering artifacts or trigger assertions in debug builds.
 *
 *
 * Exposure
 * ========
 *
 * The Camera is also used to set the scene's exposure, just like with a real camera. The lights
 * intensity and the Camera exposure interact to produce the final scene's brightness.
 *
