/**
 * IndirectLight is used to simulate environment lighting, a form of global illumination.
 *
 * Environment lighting has a two components:
 *  1. irradiance
 *  2. reflections (specular component)
 *
 * Environments are usually captured as high-resolution HDR equirectangular images and processed
 * by the **cmgen** tool to generate the data needed by IndirectLight.
 *
 * @note
 * Currently IndirectLight is intended to be used for "distant probes", that is, to represent
 * global illumination from a distant (i.e. at infinity) environment, such as the sky or distant
 * mountains. Only a single IndirectLight can be used in a Scene. This limitation will be lifted
 * in the future.
 *
 * Creation and destruction
 * ========================
 *
 * An IndirectLight object is created using the IndirectLight::Builder and destroyed by calling
 * Engine::destroy(const IndirectLight*).
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
 *  filament::Engine* engine = filament::Engine::create();
 *
 *  filament::IndirectLight* environment = filament::IndirectLight::Builder()
 *              .reflections(cubemap)
 *              .irradiance(numBands, sphericalHarmonicsCoefficients)
 *              .build(*engine);
 *
 *  engine->destroy(environment);
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 *
 * Irradiance
 * ==========
 *
 * The irradiance represents the light that comes from the environment and shines an
 * object's surface. It is represented as
 * [spherical harmonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics) (SH) of 1, 2 or
 * 3 bands, respectively 1, 4 or 9 coefficients.
 *
 * @note
 * Use the **cmgen** tool to generate the `SH` for a given environment.
 *
 * Reflections
 * ===========
 *
 * The reflections on object surfaces (specular component) is calculated from a specially
 * filtered cubemap pyramid generated by the **cmgen** tool.
 *
 *
 * @see Scene, Light, Texture, Skybox
