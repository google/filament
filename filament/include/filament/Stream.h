/**
 * Stream is used to attach a video stream to a Filament `Texture`.
 *
 * Note that the `Stream` class is fairly Android centric. It supports two different
 * configurations:
 *
 *   - ACQUIRED.....connects to an Android AHardwareBuffer
 *   - NATIVE.......connects to an Android SurfaceTexture
 *
 * Before explaining these different configurations, let's review the high-level structure of an AR
 * or video application that uses Filament:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * while (true) {
 *
 *     // Misc application work occurs here, such as:
 *     // - Writing the image data for a video frame into a Stream
 *     // - Moving the Filament Camera
 *
 *     if (renderer->beginFrame(swapChain)) {
 *         renderer->render(view);
 *         renderer->endFrame();
 *     }
 * }
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Let's say that the video image data at the time of a particular invocation of `beginFrame`
 * becomes visible to users at time A. The 3D scene state (including the camera) at the time of
 * that same invocation becomes apparent to users at time B.
 *
 * - If time A matches time B, we say that the stream is \em{synchronized}.
 * - Filament invokes low-level graphics commands on the \em{driver thread}.
 * - The thread that calls `beginFrame` is called the \em{main thread}.
 *
 * For ACQUIRED streams, there is no need to perform the copy because Filament explictly acquires
 * the stream, then releases it later via a callback function. This configuration is especially
 * useful when the Vulkan backend is enabled.
 *
 * For NATIVE streams, Filament does not make any synchronization guarantee. However they are simple
 * to use and do not incur a copy. These are often appropriate in video applications.
 *
 * Please see `sample-stream-test` and `sample-hello-camera` for usage examples.
 *
 * @see backend::StreamType
 * @see Texture#setExternalStream
 * @see Engine#destroyStream
