/**
 * Engine is filament's main entry-point.
 *
 * An Engine instance main function is to keep track of all resources created by the user and
 * manage the rendering thread as well as the hardware renderer.
 *
 * To use filament, an Engine instance must be created first:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * #include <filament/Engine.h>
 * using namespace filament;
 *
 * Engine* engine = Engine::create();
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Engine essentially represents (or is associated to) a hardware context
 * (e.g. an OpenGL ES context).
 *
 * Rendering typically happens in an operating system's window (which can be full screen), such
 * window is managed by a filament.Renderer.
 *
 * A typical filament render loop looks like this:
 *
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * #include <filament/Engine.h>
 * #include <filament/Renderer.h>
 * #include <filament/Scene.h>
 * #include <filament/View.h>
 * using namespace filament;
 *
 * Engine* engine       = Engine::create();
 * SwapChain* swapChain = engine->createSwapChain(nativeWindow);
 * Renderer* renderer   = engine->createRenderer();
 * Scene* scene         = engine->createScene();
 * View* view           = engine->createView();
 *
 * view->setScene(scene);
 *
 * do {
 *     // typically we wait for VSYNC and user input events
 *     if (renderer->beginFrame(swapChain)) {
 *         renderer->render(view);
 *         renderer->endFrame();
 *     }
 * } while (!quit);
 *
 * engine->destroy(&view);
 * engine->destroy(&scene);
 * engine->destroy(&renderer);
 * engine->destroy(&swapChain);
 * Engine::destroy(&engine); // clears engine*
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Resource Tracking
 * =================
 *
 *  Each Engine instance keeps track of all objects created by the user, such as vertex and index
 *  buffers, lights, cameras, etc...
 *  The user is expected to free those resources, however, leaked resources are freed when the
 *  engine instance is destroyed and a warning is emitted in the console.
 *
 * Thread safety
 * =============
 *
 * An Engine instance is not thread-safe. The implementation makes no attempt to synchronize
 * calls to an Engine instance methods.
 * If multi-threading is needed, synchronization must be external.
 *
 * Multi-threading
 * ===============
 *
 * When created, the Engine instance starts a render thread as well as multiple worker threads,
 * these threads have an elevated priority appropriate for rendering, based on the platform's
 * best practices. The number of worker threads depends on the platform and is automatically
 * chosen for best performance.
 *
 * On platforms with asymmetric cores (e.g. ARM's Big.Little), Engine makes some educated guesses
 * as to which cores to use for the render thread and worker threads. For example, it'll try to
 * keep an OpenGL ES thread on a Big core.
 *
 * Swap Chains
 * ===========
 *
 * A swap chain represents an Operating System's *native* renderable surface. Typically it's a window
 * or a view. Because a SwapChain is initialized from a native object, it is given to filament
 * as a `void*`, which must be of the proper type for each platform filament is running on.
 *
 * @see SwapChain
 *
 *
 * @see Renderer
