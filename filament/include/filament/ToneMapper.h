/**
 * Interface for tone mapping operators. A tone mapping operator, or tone mapper,
 * is responsible for compressing the dynamic range of the rendered scene to a
 * dynamic range suitable for display.
 *
 * In Filament, tone mapping is a color grading step. ToneMapper instances are
 * created and passed to the ColorGrading::Builder to produce a 3D LUT that will
 * be used during post-processing to prepare the final color buffer for display.
 *
 * Filament provides several default tone mapping operators that fall into three
 * categories:
 *
 * - Configurable tone mapping operators
 *   - GenericToneMapper
 * - Fixed-aesthetic tone mapping operators
 *   - ACESToneMapper
 *   - ACESLegacyToneMapper
 *   - FilmicToneMapper
 * - Debug/validation tone mapping operators
 *   - LinearToneMapper
 *   - DisplayRangeToneMapper
 *
 * You can create custom tone mapping operators by subclassing ToneMapper.
