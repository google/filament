/**
 * Holds a set of buffers that define the geometry of a Renderable.
 *
 * The geometry of the Renderable itself is defined by a set of vertex attributes such as
 * position, color, normals, tangents, etc...
 *
 * There is no need to have a 1-to-1 mapping between attributes and buffer. i.e. a buffer can
 * hold the data of several attributes -- attributes are then referred as being "interleaved".
 *
 * The buffers themselves are GPU resources, therefore mutating their data can be relatively slow.
 * For this reason, it is best to separate the constant data from the dynamic data into multiple
 * buffers.
 *
 * It is possible, and even encouraged, to use a single vertex buffer for several Renderable.
