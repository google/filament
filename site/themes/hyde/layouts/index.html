<p>
Filament is a real-time physically-based renderer written in C++. It is mobile-first, but also
multi-platform.

<p>
We are very conscientious about keeping Filament small, fast to load, and focused on
rendering. For example, Filament does not compile materials at run time. Instead, we provide a
command line tool
(<a href="https://github.com/google/filament/tree/master/tools/matc">matc</a>)
that does this offline.
